Sports Illustrated Astros cover was supposed to feature Michelle Wie | Golf.com
My colleague Richard Deitsch replied, "Admire this Jason Bourne-like stand by you. #gostros." To which I wrote back, "Like Bourne, I'm fighting against the forces of evil, a.k.a. those who keep golf off the cover. a.k.a., our bosses." Funnily enough, that was the week Stone finally decided to join Twitter. I pointed a mob of golf-mad followers in his direction and they gave him the warm welcome he deserved. Well, with Reiter using the bully pulpit of Internet fame to continue hazing me, I could think of only way to get some closure from this lingering trauma. On Thursday afternoon I begged Stone and various other editors to recreate the Wie cover that never was. At long last, here it is. Bite me, Reiter.
