Remote Area Medical –
Remote Area Medical’s mission to prevent pain and alleviate suffering is fueled by donors and volunteers who support the operation of mobile medical clinics that deliver free, high-quality vision, dental, and medical services to children, individuals, and families who do not have access or cannot afford a visit to a doctor. Since 1985, RAM’s Corps of more than 100,000 Humanitarian Volunteers, comprised of licensed dental, vision, veterinary, and medical professionals, have treated more than 700,000 individuals and 67,000 animals, delivering $112 million worth of free health care services.
In 2008, Scott Pelley from 60 Minutes came to our annual mobile medical clinic in Knoxville, Tennessee. “Lifeline” originally aired on March 2nd, 2008, exposing RAM to an international audience, illuminating the cracks in America’s healthcare system, and highlighting the humanitarian heroes who form the Remote Area Medical Volunteer Corps.
