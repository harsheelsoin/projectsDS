Medical Heritage Library – online access to seven centuries of medical history
~This post courtesy Polina Ilieva. The Local Arrangements and Program Committees are busy preparing for the upcoming joint ALHHS/MeMA meeting in Los Angeles, May 9-10, 2018.   Our conference brings together archivists, librarians, museum professionals, educators, historians and representatives of allied professions and it is the place for our community to engage, network, and learn from each other’s experiences. The advent of social media, big data, and digital environments is changing the nature of the records we collect, their dissemination, as well as educational practices. The impact of this shift challenges some theoretical and methodological paradigms of our professions. The goal of this meeting is to examine critical issues in documenting, preserving, accessing, and teaching with health sciences collections in the newly emerging landscape.     The Program Committee welcomes your help in making this a thought provoking and stimulating conference. We are especially interested in proposals that feature:             We are looking forward to seeing you in Los Angeles!   Your Program Committee: Polina Ilieva, University of California, San Francisco (chair) Beth Lander, College of Physicians of Philadelphia Jennifer Nieves, Case Western Reserve University John Rees, National Library of Medicine (History of Medicine Division)
