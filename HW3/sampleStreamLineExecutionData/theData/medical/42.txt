First round of Ohio medical marijuana grow license winners announced | 						cleveland.com
jborchardt@cleveland.com COLUMBUS, Ohio -- The Ohio Department of Commerce on Friday announced 11 companies that will grow medical marijuana in the state's new program.  The department announced winners for smaller, level II grows of up to 3,000 square feet of growing space. A department spokeswoman said the larger tier I license winners will be announced in the coming weeks.  Level II licenses were awarded to:  The licenses are for one site each, and companies that applied for several sites have 10 business days to choose one for the license. Applicants were scored on their plans for running the business, following the state's rules for packaging and quality control and security. They also had to meet financial requirements. Ohio lawmakers passed the medical marijuana law in May 2016 but gave state agencies more than two years to set up the program. The program must be fully operational by September 2018.  Once established, people with one of 21 qualifying medical conditions can buy and use marijuana if recommended to them by a physician. The law does not allow for smoking marijuana or growing it except at the state-licensed commercial grow sites. This story will be updated.
