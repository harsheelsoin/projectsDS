Can Music Be Objectively Good Or Bad?
I understand your confusion. The preceding paragraph addressed the nature of film critique, exclusively, but harbored not a single critique of music critique. My examples regarding the tumultuous nature of film critique simply serves to elicit an awareness of the Critics vs. Audiences, Enthusiasts vs. Casuals, and other "Versus" mentalities that also has a stake in music. The critical approach to music is not tumultuous...it's absolute mayhem. The denouement is that music, like any other art, is enjoyed by both enthusiasts and casual listeners. Sometimes. those casual listeners enjoy The Flaming Lips, Pink Floyd, Tom Waits, The Beatles, and other highly-acclaimed artists. Sometimes, those enthusiasts enjoy Nickelback, Creed, Drake, Jay-Z, etc. And, obviously, vice versa. Just because there is objectively good music, does not mean that all music isn't objectively enjoyable by someone, and there reasons don't need to be justified.
