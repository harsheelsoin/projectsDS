College Music Society Home
The College Music Society promotes music teaching and learning, musical creativity and expression, research and dialogue, and diversity and interdisciplinary interaction. A consortium of college, conservatory, university, and independent musicians and scholars interested in all disciplines of music, the Society provides leadership and serves as an agent of change by addressing concerns facing music in higher education.   I write to you from San Antonio following our national conference and Board meeting. The hotel felt different this morning: no conference registration desk, no exhibits, and a different group of conferees unknown to me. I missed familiar faces, the focus of presenters on the way to their sessions, the infectious bursts of laughter from colleagues gathering once again, and the curious, sometimes anxious looks of first-time attendees taking everything in, navigating their way into the fold, experiencing something new. SUBMISSION DEADLINE: 11:59 p.m. Mountain Time on Tuesday, November 28, 2017 Calls for participation have been issued for the 2018 CMS National Conference for composers, performers, scholars, researchers, pedagogues, along with opportunities for engagement with the host city of Vancouver. Review the list of calls below for more details on each opportunity. GenNext is a collaboration between The College Music Society and NAMM (the National Association of Music Merchants) that provides opportunities for college, conservatory, and university music faculty and students to  learn about the nearly $100 billion music industry and to network with industry leaders.
