Home | Longy School of Music
Fausto's Story (video) Hear Fausto Miro, M.M. ’17, Vocal Performance, describe his journey as a Longy student and his experience with our world-class faculty and professional partners. Musicians often identify as performers or educators, but seldom as healers. At Longy, our students are offered a course, “The Healing Art of Music,” that explores the human response to music, and its therapeutic capabilities. Join us for a discussion about the important work of music practitioners, with Certified Music Practitioner Dr. Clare Garabedian, a Longy alumna now teaching at the University of Worcester (UK); Aline Benoit, instructor of the “Healing Art of Music;” and students in the class.  Livestream So many factors influence identity: surroundings, mentors, colleagues, personal experiences. The Trio will explore these different facets, looking at everything from Leonard Bernstein’s Harvard years to the inspiration provided by the music of Astor Piazzolla’s Argentinian streets.  Livestream Join us for another fabulous evening of opera and revelry in a cabaret style setting, featuring seven short works — including three brand new commissions and world-premieres! Enjoy a delicious program of bite-sized opera — performed in English and accompanied by a small instrumental ensemble — along with festive food and drink!
