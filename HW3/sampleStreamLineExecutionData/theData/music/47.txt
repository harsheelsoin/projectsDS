Music and Memory No one wants to end up alone and isolated in a nursing home. It’s hard enough to lose someone you love to Alzheimer’s or other forms of dementia. It’s terrifying to think you could end up there yourself, someday. But there’s reason to hope for a better life as we age. At MUSIC & MEMORY℠, we help people in nursing homes and other care organizations who suffer from a wide range of cognitive and physical challenges to find renewed meaning and connection in their lives through the gift of personalized music. Our approach is simple, elegant and effective: We train care professionals how to set up personalized music playlists, delivered on iPods and other digital devices, for those in their care. These musical favorites tap deep memories not lost to dementia and can bring participants back to life, enabling them to feel like themselves again, to converse, socialize and stay present. Meet Henry, who suffered from dementia for a decade and barely said a word to anyone—until Music & Memory set up an iPod program at his nursing home: Our goal is to make this miraculous form of personalized therapeutic music the gold standard in care organizations throughout the U.S. and beyond—and train family caregivers to bring personalized digital music to their loved ones at home. There are millions like Henry struggling to escape the isolation of dementia. Please help them feel alive again through MUSIC & MEMORY℠.   3 Oct 2017 “Frank Sinatra—what movie was he in again?” “Guys & Dolls!” “That’s a good one!” For seniors at Long Island’s Sid
