Politics | The New School for Social Research (NSSR)
Deva Woodly, Professor of Politics, discusses how dissonance is not just a part of democracy, but crucial to its existence.
The Department of Politics at The New School for Social Research takes a distinctive approach to the study of politics. We emphasize the theoretical dimension of political analysis with regard to both political explanation and normative evaluation. We focus on the historical roots of contemporary political forces and problems. Faculty members are interested in how institutions shape political life, in the intersection of political and cultural processes, and in classical and current conceptions of political economy. Distinguished visiting scholars from other institutions join our faculty on a regular basis. Visiting professors are an important part of the department’s life; they assist the regular faculty by helping supervise dissertations and other student work. The Politics Department welcomes proposals to visit from faculty and advanced graduate students, which we review once per term (fall and spring) each academic year. All approved visitors have access to the university library and public seminars, lectures, and conferences, as well as the general IT services at the university.
