MiraCosta College - Astronomy
Astronomy,
the oldest of all scientific studies, has played a vital
role in the
development of modern science. Astronomers study the
formation, composition,
and evolution of objects such as planets,
stars, galaxies, nebulae, black
holes, and the universe itself.
Students may take courses to prepare for a
major in astronomy or to
fulfill general education requirements. Career options include teaching,
museum or
planetarium director, astronomer/astrophysicist, space scientist,
mission data analyst, space craft and instrument designer, observatory
technician, telescope operator, optics or electronics technician,
computer
programmer, and mathematician. LEARN MORE CONNECT Â© 2014 MiraCosta College. All Rights Reserved. MIRACOSTA COLLEGE FOUNDATION
