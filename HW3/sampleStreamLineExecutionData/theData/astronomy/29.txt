Marking the beginning of a new era in astrophysics, scientists have detected gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation, or light, from the same event for the first time. This historic discovery reveals the merger of two neutron stars, the dense cores of dead stars, and resolves the debate about how the heaviest elements such as platinum and gold were created in the Universe.
"If governments and their space agencies are serious about protecting Earth from solar storms, one team of researchers argues a giant space shield is the most logical solution."
Hear about an amazing discovery in the Plate Stacks and the Wolbach library spanning more than a century. Items are on display in Wolbach.
Tansu is a 4th year PhD student in the Physics Department, working with Douglas P. Finkbeiner in astro-particle physics. The main focus of his research is dark matter, i.e., how dark matter forms structure and its potential interactions with the Standard Model. Having worked on the excess of gamma-rays from the inner Milky Way in the beginning of his PhD, he is currently interested in implementing a Bayesian framework to perform transdimensional inference on a hypothesis space, given some astronomical observation. In his free time, he likes to dance Tango and Bachata, communicate science through outreach and fly airplanes. Read More » View all Faculty and Student Spotlights
