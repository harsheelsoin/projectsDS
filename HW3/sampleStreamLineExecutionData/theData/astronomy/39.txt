Departments of Physics and Astronomy | Haverford College
The concepts and methods of physics are fundamental throughout the sciences, and have produced profound scientific, philosophical, and technological developments. Our departments are built on close work between students and faculty on cutting-edge research, with nearly all physics, astronomy and astrophysics majors participating. The Astronomical Society of the Pacific selected the emeritus professor of physics and astronomy for his outstanding achievement in the teaching of college-level introductory astronomy for non-science majors.
