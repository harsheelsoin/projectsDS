Astronomy | U-M LSA Astronomy
A University of Michigan doctoral student has logged two pieces of evidence that may support the existence of a planet that could be part of our solar system, beyond Neptune. NASA has announced that the Arcus X-ray mission concept has been selected for a "Phase A" study as part of the $250 million Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) program. We strive to support our students and faculty on the frontlines of learning and research; to steward our planet, our community, our campus. To do this, the Department of Astronomy needs youâ€”because the world needs Victors.
