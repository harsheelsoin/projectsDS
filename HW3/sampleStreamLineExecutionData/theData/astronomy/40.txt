Smith College: Astronomy
Astronomy is the study of the cosmos, from our home planet to the farthest reaches of the universe. One of the original liberal arts, astronomy offers an unparalleled perspective for appreciating our planet and the life that it supports. It also provides an opportunity to appreciate the simplicity of the forces of nature and understand how these forces govern the origin and evolution of our universe.
