Bad Astronomy | SYFY WIRE
The Bad Astronomy blog is all about real-world science — it covers the entire Universe, from subatomic particles to the Big Bang itself. Astronomy, space exploration, the effect of politics on science...you'll find it all here, as well as anything else that pops in to Phil Plait's science-drenched brain. And you'll find it described with obvious joy and love for all things cosmic. © 2017. All rights reserved
