National Radio Astronomy Observatory - National Radio Astronomy Observatory
Radio waves are simply another band -- or range of color -- of light. While stars shine most brightly at optical wavelengths, they also shine across the spectrum, including radio waves. Other objects, like star-forming clouds, emit little to any visible light, though they shine brightly in radio light. Our cutting-edge telescopes are used to make new, radio discoveries every day, by penetrating through the dust and clouds of galaxies that obscures visible light.
Interactively learn about our Universe, our telescopes, and the people who make it all possible. The VLA made the first detection of radio waves coming from the neutron-star collision that generated a ripple of gravitational waves. Radio telescopes will continue to reveal new facts about this phenomenon in the coming months. Astronomers from a Canadian consortium will develop a data center to perform advanced processing of VLA Sky Survey data to augment its scientific value. A new record for directly measuring distances within our home Galaxy gives astronomers the ability to finally produce an accurate map of the whole extent of the Milky Way. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in the Atacama Desert, Chile, is the most complex observatory ever built. The VLA is the most advanced radio telescope array on Earth, a customizable interferometer that spans up to 22 miles across.

Check out our Milky Way Explorer, a guided trip through our spiral Galaxy and its neighborhood. You choose where to explore, and a radio astronomer talks to you about each stop. Hear from folks who work at NRAO about the many paths we've taken to get here. You donâ€™t have to be a scientist or engineer to be part of our exciting mission!
