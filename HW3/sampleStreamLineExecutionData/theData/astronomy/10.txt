Find out more.   On a chilly February evening in 1889 in San Francisco, astronomers from Lick Observatory and members of the Pacific Coast Amateur Photographic Association — fresh from viewing the New Year’s Day total solar eclipse north of the City — met to share pictures and experiences. Edward Holden, Lick’s first director, complimented the amateurs on their service to science, and proposed to continue the good fellowship through the founding of a Society to advance the science of Astronomy, and to diffuse information concerning it. Thus the Astronomical Society of the Pacific was born. Through more than a century of operation, as human understanding of the universe has advanced, so has the ASP — connecting scientists, educators, amateur astronomers and the public to share astronomical research, conduct professional development in science education, and provide resources that engage students and adults alike in the adventure of scientific discovery.   Media inquiries: media {at} astrosociety.org   The ASP is proud to participate in the Annual Combined Federal Campaign (CFC #10651), a workplace giving program supported by Federal civilian, postal, and military donors around the world.
