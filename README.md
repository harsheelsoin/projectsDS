# Homework 1
The three python files correspond to questions 1, 2 and 3 of the first homework.
Python 2.7.13 has been used.

Please download entire directory to run scripts. The scripts will need all folders in directory to get paths for necessary processing. Paths in scripts will be adjusted automatically based on your system once you download this directory.

If issues are still encoutered with paths, kindly use following:

inputPath = <your_download_directory>/HW1/classify/

outputPath = <your_download_directory>/HW1/classify_out

Outputs of my codes are given in the sub-directory: 'outputsObtained' (for your reference).
Latest versions of the same can also be found in the sub-directory 'classify_out'
