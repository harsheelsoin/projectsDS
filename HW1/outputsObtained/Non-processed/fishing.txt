Perch fishing has been good in the southeast region of the state. The panfish, bass and pike action has picked up on the inland lakes.

Mail the form with a stamped, self-addressed envelope to the DNR Customer Service Center. Catch most fish species year-round. Note: There are season restrictions for trout on inland streams, Lake Michigan and its tributaries, and for paddlefish on the Ohio River. Fish with a trot line – a line that extends into the water from a fixed point and has smaller drop lines attached to it; limited to one trot line at a time with no more than 50 single- or multi-barbed hooks, and each drop line having only one hook. A legible tag with the name and address of the user must be affixed to each trot line. Take carp, gar, bowfin, buffalo and shad with a spear, gig, spear gun, bow and arrow or underwater spear under certain conditions and on limited waters. Crossbows may not be used. See fishing.IN.gov for details. Float or jug fish by using a buoyed container that suspends a single line and a single- or multi-barbed hook. As many as five floats may be used. Each float must be marked with the user’s name and address, and the user must be in constant visual contact with all floats. NOTE: Float fishing is not allowed on lakes and reservoirs for public safety reasons. Use landing nets, gaff hooks or grab hooks to assist in landing legally caught fish. Note: These devices may not be used as a method of catching fish. Keep fish you catch for an aquarium if the fish meets legal size and bag limit requirements. Take smelt from Lake Michigan and Oliver Lake (LaGrange County) from March 1 through May 30. Smelt may be taken only with a single seine or net. The seine or net may not exceed 12 feet in length and 6 feet in depth nor have a stretch mesh larger than 1 ½ inches. A dip net may not exceed 12 feet in diameter. Brookville Reservoir

Rare to find these days.
A local bait and tackle shop with a selection that rivals Dicks.
If you looking for tackle for freshwater or saltwater, you can find it here. The owner is knowledgable and helpful, but some of the workers don't fish at all.
Huge selection of rods- $20 no name rods to Lamiglas rods. Same for the reels- nice selection and they have Van Stals.
I picked up a new St Croix Mojo rod for $70. Sweet....
A lot of rigs, lures, and all types of tackle. They also sell used gear.
The sell live bait, but I have never purchased any from them, so I won't comment.
Have Fun
A few years back, purchased blood worms and they all too small and skinny so complete wasted money. All the merchandise are too pricy in this store! I've seen better prices via on line.
Stopped in to get some fatheads. Chinese guy looked at us like we were from another planet when we asked for fatheads. Had no clue what they were. Told em live fish bait and he said we no have. Looked to side and all the tanks were empty. Asked for mealworms and he says maybe next week. Are you kidding me? Opening weekend and you have no bait? So much for a "bait" & tackle store.
Guy is very friendly.
Store has ALOT to offer.
tons of fishing poles and tackle and fishing gear.
They also have bait and bunkers. and offer deep sea trips.
And the prices are good.
lures are cheaper then big sporting good stores.
This is my new fishing shop.

Coast Guard Station Oregon Inlet was notified at 5 p.m. and launched a motor lifeboat. Upon arrival, the boat crew spotted the vessel capsized in 4 to 6 inch breaking seas, along with numerous pieces of debris in the water. The crew spotted five people on board all huddled together, struggling to stay above water. The crew was able to get to the people to safety. From Coast Guard photos it appears the boat that capsized, Synergy from Manteo, is a 54-foot Custom Carolina sport-fishing boat built by Gwaltney Boat Works in 1990, according to information from Synergy Sportfishing. A Facebook page for Synergy Sportfishing lists the boat as a charter fishing vessel, which underwent a complete renovation in the Spring of 2017.
The five people were transported back to the Station where Dare County EMS was awaiting to assist and transport to a local hospital.   Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) More More Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Search suspended for missing NC boater after fisherman dies, Coast Guard says VIDEO: 5 rescued from capsized boat near NC island Search for two missing NC boaters suspended by Coast Guard VIDEO: Coast Guard rescues 1 child, 4 adults from water off NC coast Advertisement Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:

A reel fish story: Westfield boy receives awards for fishing			 Current Publishing Westfield Community By Rick Morwick Between work, school and football practice, Reece Fisher doesn’t have a lot of time for fishing. But when he does get out, he makes the most of each cast. Reece Fisher spends his time fishing in tournaments. (Submitted photo) He has the trophies to prove it. A Westfield High School sophomore, Fisher, 15, has been a tournament bass fisherman for two years. He has competed in – and won – events across Indiana and recently placed fifth at The Bass Federation’s 2017 Junior World Championships on Lake Wateree in Camden, S.C. For that effort, Fisher reeled in several hundred dollars in scholarship money (he’s unsure of the exact amount) and established himself as one of the nation’s top competitors in the 11- to 15-year-old age group. He’s been fishing since age 3. “I enjoy it a lot,” said Fisher, who competed against 34 other anglers at the Aug. 11-12 Junior World. “I enjoy being out on the lake and just the thrill of catching fish, especially if it’s a big one. They pull pretty hard on your line.” A member of the Indiana Bass Federation, Fisher is the only serious angler in his family. His late grandfather was a recreational fisherman, but neither of his parents, Dawn and Mic Fisher, or younger sister, Addison, takes to the water like he does. “We bought him a fishing pole from Walmart when he was about 3 years old and took him fishing to our neighborhood pond,” Dawn said. “As he gold older, he and some of his buddies would ride their bikes to different neighborhoods in Westfield and fish the retention ponds.” Now, he fishes many of Indiana’s largest lakes in age group tournaments. He qualified for the Junior World by winning the Sept. 24, 2016 Indiana Bass Federation State Finals at Tippecanoe Lake. He also has competed in IBF events at Lake Monroe and Geist and Morse reservoirs, among other waterways. A linebacker on Westfield’s junior varsity football team, Reece has a part-time job and spends what little spare time he has watching fishing videos and researching the latest in lures. “We think his hobby is great and are happy he has found something he is passionate about,” Dawn said. “We also love that he is outdoors and not inside playing video games. We hope this encourages younger children who enjoy fishing to get involved in the Indiana Bass Federation.” Share.

Fishing
Fishing NPS/Neal Herbert About 50,000 of the park’s four million visitors fish each year. Fishing has been a popular recreation activity for visitors here for more than 100 years, and many people come to Yellowstone just to fish. Though angling is an anomaly in a park where the primary purpose is to preserve natural environments and native species in ways that maintain natural conditions, fishing in Yellowstone can help support preservation of native species. Authorized Fishing and Boating Tour Guides Current Conditions - USGS Links to Yellowstone's Stream Flows Jump to Page Section Fishing Regulations Handling and Releasing Fish Fish Identification Fishing in Yellowstone If you’re planning to fish while visiting Yellowstone, this video will provide you with the information you need to plan your fishing outing.
Water-related Rules & Safety The hot water of Yellowstone's thermal features is dangerous, but far more people have been killed by exposure to the cold waters of the park's lakes and rivers. Birds, such as loons, waterfowl, cranes, and shorebirds, are vulnerable to lead poisoning. While we can do little about natural hazards, we can minimize the effects of lead on these species. Yellowstone National Park bans most lead tackle. (Terminal tackle must be lead-free. Large downrigger weights used to fish for deep-dwelling lake trout are permissible because they are too large to be ingested.) Anglers Assist with Native Species Conservation The activities necessary to preserve and restore native fish varies by species and drainages across the park. In order to promote the preservation of native fish in Yellowstone, the park has designated the Native Trout Conservation Area for special management. Within that area, fishing regulations are structured so that recreational anglers help selectively remove nonnative species from the area without damaging the native fishery. In some areas, anglers' harvests will help to save the native fish and the natural ecosystems they support. Decisions about how best to achieve native fish preservation and recovery goals must be based in sound scientific research and be consistent with the mission of the National Park Service. Most years, a team of fly-fishing volunteers assist the Yellowstone fisheries program with several other projects, including removal of non-native species, evaluation of fish barrier efficacy and success, a study to determine injury and mortality rates when using barbed versus barbless hooks, surveys to determine species composition, and logistical support for large multi-agency projects. Their extensive help collecting data and biological samples allows park biologists to learn about many more areas than park staff would have time to access. Volunteers interact with visitors and other fly fishers and are able to discuss important topics, such as park fishing regulations, the reasoning behind some of the more controversial restoration projects, and why native fish are an important resource in Yellowstone. —please don't mix information from multiple locations— Thank you for supporting our fisheries management program by returning these cards to park biologists. Sorry, but there is no program for 2017. Fishing Regulations Fishing regulations in Yellowstone National Park are structured to strongly support native fish conservation goals. Fishing/angling is defined as any activity using an attended single rod or line for the purpose of attempting to attract, capture, or possess any fish from waters within Yellowstone National Park. All other methods to attract, capture, or possess fish are prohibited. Fishing Season & Hours The season begins the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend (usually the last weekend in May) and extends through the first Sunday in November. Exceptions are noted in each of the regional regulations. Hours are daily from sunrise to sunset. Fishing with an artificial light is prohibited. Some areas are closed to human entry, have trail or seasonal closures, off-trail travel and daylight hour limitations, or party size recommendations. See the Bear Management Area restrictions in the Backcountry Trip Planner for specific rules and information. Permits Three-day permit: $18 Seven-day permit: $25 Season-long permit: $40 Park rangers may check permits and inspect tackle, fish, creels, or other containers where fish or tackle may be stored. Anglers 15 years of age or younger have two options: Children 15 or younger may fish without a permit if they are fishing under the direct supervision of an adult who has a valid park fishing permit. Children 15 or younger may obtain a free permit that must be signed by a responsible adult. With this permit, a child can fish without direct adult supervision. Tackle, Lure & Hook Restrictions Each angler may use only one rod which must be attended at all times and used for angling only—intentional snagging of fish is not allowed. Only lead-free artificial lures (e.g. spoon or spinner) or flies may be used. Leaded fishing tackle such as leaded split-shot sinkers, weighted jigs (lead molded to a hook), and soft lead-weighted ribbon for nymph fishing are not allowed. Hooks must have points that are barbless, or the barbs must be pinched down by pliers. Lures may have only one hook with a single, double, or treble configuration. Each fly may have only one hook. Up to two flies may be used on a single leader (commonly referred to as “dropper,” “dry and dropper,” or “hopper and dropper”). Except for feathers and other typical fly-tying materials, the hook must be bare. No organic or inorganic baits are allowed. Organic baits include fish or fish parts, minnows, salmon eggs, worms, insects, or foodstuffs such as bread and corn. Inorganic baits include rubber worms and plastic “twister” tails. Scented attractants (liquid and solid baits) are illegal. Putting any substance in the water for the purpose of attracting fish (chumming) is illegal. Non-toxic split-shot, sinkers, and jig heads molded with bismuth-tin, molybdenum, or tungsten are allowed. Lead core line and heavy (> 4 lb.) downrigger weights used to fish for deep-dwelling lake trout are permissible because they are too large to be ingested by wildlife. Artificial lures are not allowed on the Firehole River, Madison River, and lower Gibbon River below Gibbon Falls. These streams are fly fishing only. Possession Limits It is the responsibility of the angler to be able to identify fish by species. Unintentionally killed fish should be returned to the water so they can be consumed by wildlife. All native fish must be released unharmed. Natives include cutthroat trout, mountain whitefish, and Arctic grayling. No possession limit for nonnative fish, including brown, brook, rainbow, and lake trout. You may harvest as many nonnative fish from this area as you want. All native fish must be released unharmed. Possession limits exist for nonnative fish in this area. An angler must cease fishing in the area immediately after filling the possession limit. Firehole River, Madison River, lower Gibbon River (downstream of Gibbon Falls)—possession of up to five brook trout is allowed. Catch and release all rainbow and brown trout. Whitefish are an important native species in the Madison River and they must be released. Lewis River system above Lewis Falls, including Lewis and Shoshone lakes and their tributaries— possession of five combined brook, brown or lake trout; only one of which may be a brown trout. Evidence of Species in Possession Skin must remain attached so the fish species can be visibly identified. Gills and entrails may be removed in the field, but must be discarded only within the waters where the fish were caught. Disposal of Fish & Entrails Dispose of fish and/or fish entrails within the waters where the fish was caught but not within 100 feet (30.5 m) of boat ramps, docks, or backcountry campsites. Fish can also be disposed of in park trash cans. Bridge & Boat Dock Restrictions No fishing from any road bridge or boat dock. Boating—Vessel Inspections & Permits All vessels—including float tubes— require a boat permit. All vessels also require a life vest for each passenger, and an emergency sound device such as a whistle or air horn. All vessels must be checked by National Park Service inspectors to ensure that they are free of aquatic invasive species before entering any park waters. Yellowstone has adopted a barbless hook rule, to reduce handling time and injury, and improve the overall condition and appearance of fishes, especially in heavily fished waters.

Park fishing regulations are designed to protect native fish and aquatic ecosystems, provide recreational opportunities, and also preserve the tradition of angling in Yellowstone. Cutthroat trout, Arctic grayling, mountain whitefish, and other native fishes are important to the ecology of Yellowstone. Because cutthroat trout and Arctic grayling inhabit relatively shallow waters, many animals depend on them as a food source, especially during spring when the fish spawn in small lake inlets and tributary streams. Angling is an important part of the park’s cultural history. Nonnative trout are important to the angler experience in Yellowstone, but they contribute to the decline in the park’s native cutthroat trout and Arctic grayling by competing for food and habitat, preying on native fish, and degrading the genetic integrity of native fish by hybridizing with them. Yellowstone is making a substantial, on-the-ground effort to conserve native fish in several areas. These actions, which are currently focused in the Lamar and Grayling Creek drainages and Yellowstone Lake, are described in the park’s native fish conservation plan. Goals are to reduce the risk of extinction, restore and maintain the ecological role, and create sustainable angling and viewing opportunities for native fish. Handling & Releasing Fish To better ensure survival of hooked fish, follow these guidelines. Please help us maintain quality fisheries within the park for future generations to enjoy! Handling For all native fish and any nonnative fish you intend to release, bring the fish in as quickly as possible. Do not play the fish to exhaustion. Always make sure your hands are wet if you must handle the fish. Dry hands damage a fish’s protective mucous film. Hold the fish with one hand around the tail section and the other beneath the belly, just behind the pectoral fins. Never grab or hold a fish through the gills unless it is already dead. If you want a photo of the fish, make sure the photographer is ready before you handle the fish. Make it quick. Unhooking Unhook the fish in quiet water such as an eddy or slow spot. Do not drag the fish across land. Use forceps or small needle-nosed pliers to quickly remove the hook. Tackle, Lures & Hooks Hooks and lures typically have barbs when purchased. With small pliers you must pinch down the barbs. Without barbs more skill is required in landing and bringing in fish, but hook removal is easier and less traumatic to the fish. Spinning lures typically have three hooks called treble hooks. With wire cutters you can snip off one of the hooks or snap one off with pliers; you also must pinch down all the barbs. Two hooks are still effective, easier to remove, and less traumatic. If the fish is deeply hooked, cut the line, do not pull out the hook. Most fish can survive with hooks left in. Exhausted Fish Never just throw a fish back into the water. If a fish becomes passive, it is probably close to exhaustion. Gently remove the hook within calm water, then lightly cradle the fish with your hands to see what it does. If it struggles to keep itself upright, hold the fish around its tail and beneath its belly with its head facing upstream into the current. Move the fish gently back and forth toward and away from the current. You should notice the gills opening and closing due to the rush of water. This is like giving a fish mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. When the fish has recovered, it should swim away on its own.

Fishing Tackle Fishing Tackle Seeking an Encounter with an Unknown Fish Why do you like fishing? There will be thousands of answers to this question. Fish variety differs from season to season, and from region to region. People in different regions are likely to enjoy fishing in different ways. Some people say that fishing is a sport, while others say it is a pastime. Still others say it is a science, while others say it is a means to instill themselves deep in the bosom of mother Nature. The presence of so many views indicates that fishing has deep meaning that allows various interpretations. No matter how you define fishing, it enriches anglers’ daily lives and makes them happy. Fishing has been a subject of many literary works, including fiction, documentaries, and scientific documents. To promote the existing fishing culture, and to create a new fishing culture, Shimano is committed to various activities to introduce the enjoyment of fishing. Shimano TV, on our website, for instance, offers films that have been aired on TV, DVD programs, and original programs made for the website, so that viewers can access programs they are interested in at any time from anywhere. Development of new fishing tackle of course entails technological development. At Shimano we have been committed to technological improvement in order to enhance basic performances and introduce innovative functions. We have found, however, that this approach is not sufficient. Instead of regarding fishing tackle as a mere tool to catch fish, we have begun to regard it as a tool to enjoy fishing. This new conception has led us to a higher stage of development, enabling us to create products that appeal to anglers’ sensitivity. In quest of a perfect visual image, grip feeling, and user comfort, we are now developing exciting equipment that truly enhances the enjoyment of fishing. In developing fishing tackle, Shimano deals with not just technologies, but also anglers’ sensitivity, and even their subconscious expectations. To Product PageFishing

Fishing Fishing is allowed on City-owned reservoirs, lakes and streams as designated by specific DEP signs and according to all applicable New York State regulations. Most City-owned reservoirs offer excellent fishing opportunities for both warm-water species such as smallmouth and largemouth bass, as well as cold-water species such as trout. City-owned reservoirs are open for fishing from shore and with fishing boats, and it is common for many reservoirs to produce 4-5 pound bass and lake trout exceeding 15 pounds! In addition to its reservoirs, DEP also offers City-owned watershed lands that border excellent trout fishing streams such as the Batavia Kill, West Branch Delaware River, Esopus Creek, and many smaller tributaries.

Best line on the market This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. A friend told me about this line and I will never use anything else. The only draw back is when I am lake fishing the line does not cut thru the water as fast as mono. But I will
sacrifice that to never loose a fish again.
My wife had some mono line on her reel and it got snagged in the weeds and snap, hook, line, sinker and bobber.
The next weekend we went back to the lake and we were fishing the same area and I pulled her whole set up out of the weeds without loosing a thing with my fireline. This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. read more Click to read full text of review titled "".

have an expensive 7ft 4 inch KVD Tour Spinning Rod and T40 Carbon Reel and the Mitchell is heavier but not by much so its very light and comfortable when casting all day. I liked it so much I bought a second one. Impressive casting This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. I bought this reel and rod combo about a month ago and it has replaced my favorite up to this point reel. It is noticeable the difference between my old spinning. The reel has incredible smooth and & quiet motion. The 8 ball bearings provide great casting and retraction. It was an impulse buy and I read reviews afterward which made me second guess but knock on wood this is my favorite reel & rod combo. Made me a Mitchell believer and customer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Have not used it yet....sorry This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. read more Click to read full text of review titled "Have not used it yet....sorry".

Hope someone there could understand how much money could be transferred having meetings there. Great little reel. This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. Bought this reel a few weeks ago and put it on a 3' ice fishing rod for my daughter who is 2 1/2. Very pleased with this reel, casts smooth, light weight and easy to use. She loves it. Great rod for a woman This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. My wife like the action and strong back bone. And the feeling of the rod. Can't beat it This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. Bought this rod for my girlfriend for Christmas but couldn't wait. We took it striper fishing just to see how it did. First fish broke off using 12lb line. But was happy to see her haul in a 6lb striper yesterday. I am very impressed with the this rod and ugly stik as a whole. Will be buying there striper combos for bigger striper soon. This reel works Great in Rain and Wind too! This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. I love my Ardent Pro bait casting reel. These reels have worked great for me in all conditions, wet, windy, sunny and dry and hot! They have not let me down, while others are picking at theirs, I am casting away. Awesome reel This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. I personally like this reel, It is smooth in operation and can cast a long distance. Once you have it dialed in backlashing is minimal. This frog is awesome This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. These frogs are good, they walk across the water easily and before you know it a fish is hitting your lure. The first day i bought the lure my first cast I hit a bass. Definitely catches fish! This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. I've used several frogs before but used the pad crusher for the first time yesterday and boy, was I impressed. A lot cheaper compared to other brands and did everything right. Caught a nice fatty on my 3rd cast and then some. Great for the price Great Lure! This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. I bought this lure a month ago and I always keep it in my tackle bag. i've caught five 2+ pound bass in a day using this bait on the flats. i recommend this bait. Great Quality Jig and Sharpest Hook This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. Used these and few other styles of the Strike King TroKar jigs and could not be happier. Great quality and components. And the TroKar hook is seriously the sharpest hook on the planet. i just love it color everything This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. I saw this at another place it lasted about a week and this one is brand new so I will buy it They work This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. I was skeptical at first but I bought a pack of D-Bombs to see what all the fuss was about. After throwing a jig, beavers, and Pit Bosses on my last scouting trip I decided to try these baits. All I can say is they eat um. Often. I'm a firm believe in the D-Bombs now. Not to mention they smell so good I want to eat them myself. My only complaint is that they need to make one in a "blue saphire" color. Other than that, I 100% recommend these baits to anyone who wants to catch more fish. My go to bait This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. This is my favorite go to bait. I use a 1/8 weighted hook with a screw lock and texas rig it. It has been working for me all the time. Whenever other baits are not working for me I always go to a D-Bomb. My Go To This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. I bought these the other day and first cast I had a nice hook up. The action of the tail is the best I've used. Great imitation and colors are amazing. great versatile bait This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. Great weight and buoyancy for skipping under trees and dock... also works in heavy cover or open water, the action of this bait is amazing and almost effortless Berst Hook On Market This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. Most Versatile Well Built Hook I Have Ever Used. Strong, Perfectly Waited And did I say "SHARP" Don't hesitate This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. Have been happy with Costa for years but after trying these, I'll never go back. Just wait til you see the water bead off the Carl Zeiss lenses! Great product, durrable This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. Bought this to put on my Toyota truck bed rail system to hold my rods instead of laying them in the bed. This way I could carry 12 rods and reels and still have the bed of the truck for other cargo. I mounted 4 of them on to the bed rail system with stainless steal bots, nuts and washers without having to drill a single hole. Works great and looks cool Great option to Texas rigging This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. These are awesome for anything plastic. The swivel allows movement in current that I believe makes a difference. Very easy to use. A little pricey though. Shad Pole This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. Haven't had a chance to use yet but judging by the videos and the reviews is going to be awesome can't wait THE go-to lure! This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. I almost always start my fishing trips using the shad pole lures. They work excellent for everything from crappie, walleye, bass, and catfish. If I haven't caught anything in the first half hour with this lure then the fish are probably not gonna be biting at all. The lure size and rotating tail make them irresistible to hungry fish. Good Float This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. I bought this at the beginning of summer and have fished it hard. It casts very well and is noisy with a good slurp/gulp sound when the float dips under water. Also, the small beads make a clack when worked lightly. The paint has started coming off, but that doesn't affect the fish. I like this one more than the outcast as the leader attaches to the bottom, not the same eyelet as the line...makes for less tangles.
It's tough to see at night, that's my only complaint. Great corks This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. Have caught alot of fish on these corks hands down best action.. This gloves are the best I've ever used! This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. I purchased these glove a few weeks ago. They have been very useful at work and keep my hands protected. These glove last longer than most gloves do. I always repurchase. They are the best. I've recommend these gloves to my friends at work now I see these purple glove on all my gal pals at work. Awesome gloves This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. My wife loves these gloves and she used them for gardening. They are great for the price Cach 5lbs+ bass!!! This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. My dad went to a turn a minute and he brought home a bunch of striking Lewers I solve the recon worms and I used a Texas rig and I casted out on my first gas and caught a 5 pound bass this is a great Bait I think everyone should buy it. Best 'big worms' on the market This reviewer rated product 5 out of 5 stars. The action created by the Rage Tail is fantastic! These worms are great for large bass, but not too big for smaller 1 & 2 pounders either. Excellent for working off ridges 2017-09-17 bvseo_sps, prod_bvsp cp_1 tr_31 loc_en_US, PRD clientname_Academy, pc_18, tc_18 bvseo_sdk, java_sdk, bvseo-3.1.1 CLOUD, getContent, 270ms SPOTLIGHTS, CATEGORY Fishing Gear Expert Fishing Equipment Stock Up On Fishing Supplies Fishing Rod Parts & Accessories Terminal Tackle Fishing Tackle Storage Fishing Rods Fishing Reels Waders Rod & Reel Combos Fishing Line Fishing Supplies Fishing Tackle

A unique confluence of history, climate, natural beauty, cultural diversity, architecture and unabashed romantic appeal make the island a destination far removed from the everyday world. For anglers, billfish beyond the reef, tuna, permit and tarpon on the flats are just a few of the local game fish that offer challenging displays of strength. Ernest Hemingway, who lived and wrote in Key West throughout the 1930s, immersed himself in Florida Keys game fishing and did much to popularize it among fellow writers, readers and sportsmen. Hemingway plied the waters between Key West and Cuba aboard his 38-foot fishing boat, Pilar. Encounters with finned prey found their way into his books from "To Have and Have Not," set in Depression-era Key West, to the Nobel Prize-winning "The Old Man and the Sea." Highly-skilled offshore captains are eager to show you the Florida Straits, a 90-mile-wide trough of deep water beyond our reef that Hemingway dubbed "the Great Blue River." Key West charter guides specialize in catching snappers and groupers that inhabit our shipwrecks, reefs, inshore channels and uninhabited mangrove islands of our backcountry.

We’re Killing the Oldest Fish in the Sea Fishing eliminates most of the older fish, a new study finds, and the ecological implications are disturbing—but marine reserves can help. View Images An Atlantic cod swims through a kelp-forested peak on the highest underwater range in the Gulf of Maine, Cashes Ledge. In one of the first studies of its kind, a team of fish experts used models and fish-catch data to analyze 63 major fish populations around the United States and Europe, from Atlantic cod and Greenland halibut to rockfish, hake, grouper, and sole. They found significant declines in the oldest fish in nearly 80 percent of the populations. In roughly one-third, the number of older fish had declined by more than 90 percent. Older fish may eat different things and live in different areas of the ocean from their younger counterparts. Many fish settle as juveniles in kelp or mangrove beds then move offshore. Older fish also tend be better at producing viable offspring—offspring that tend to be larger. Killing too many older fish can make the rest of the population more susceptible to disease, rising temperatures, or pollution, and can put the entire population at greater risk of collapse, researchers suggests. Just like protecting the oldest trees in an old-growth forest, "biodiversity translates to more stability," Barnett says.

Watch: Seal Pup Rescued From Fishing Nets
The problem is actually quite simple. Few fishing methods distinguish between young fish and old fish, so most commercial operations wind up hauling in fish of many ages. Over time, all fish are exposed repeatedly to nets or hooks. As they age, fewer and fewer of the older ones escape being caught. They are disproportionately reduced in number. For example, he says, Pacific whiting (also called hake), one of the biggest fisheries along the West Coast of the U.S., is considered well-managed. The fish is used in fish sandwiches, frozen fish sticks, omega-3 oils and surimi. Whiting numbers currently are quite high. Yet researchers found that fishing had taken more than 90 percent of the oldest age group. "If you don't like that," Branch says, "then we have to change the way we manage fisheries." A Simple Solution One way is to adopt so-called slot limits—limits on catching fish above a certain size. That would tend to protect older members of a population. But it can also be complex and expensive, both for the industry and regulators. An alternative is to rotate fishing zones season after season, much as farmers rotate crops, to give some areas a chance to recover. But perhaps the simplest way of protecting old fish is one that has earned more attention in recent years: establish marine reserves. By protecting more areas as no-fishing zones, you assure some portion of the senior age class is never in danger of being caught. "I'm a firm proponent that some areas should be set aside," Branch says. "To keep old fish, you're going to have to give up some portion of the catch." But, he adds, that might be the best way to make sure that fish are around to catch for years to come. "Consider it an insurance policy," he says.

Got this today in store at my local lego store, came home and started assembling. Did not notice the time go by and I had finished it in less than 5 hours. Very entertaining and very detailed. I was suprised by everything you can fit into the store. Only downside is that the walk way to the office I presume, is too small for a minifigure to squeeze through. That would be my only complaint. 5 5 ElBricksperto Hands down the BEST modular building EVER This set is so amazing. Play value is great, Build quality is outstanding, part selection is perfect, Overall it's such a great and unique set like no other! This is by far my favorite Ideas set ever released and I would not think twice about buying any more sets like this, amazing! Also I might go and buy another one just to see what I can come up with using the parts and try and make a second shop to go next to it. 5 5 Chickey Fun build I love this set, it's quite easy to build. Overall it's fun, packed and quirky. If you like the modular builds then you need to get this set. The detail is amazing and there's lots of interesting features that make this a ramshackle fishing store. 5 5 Dvsjackal Best set ever? I have all the Lego modular sets, and in my own personal opinion this Lego Ideas set is by far the best "modular" set yet!
Me and my daughter spent 5 hours constructing it, and i was just amazed by how much detail there is!
for me this set, sets a bench for the next Lego Modular Building.
