There are thousands of miles of trails across the state for hikers of all abilities, whether you want to hike the Appalachian Trail or take the family out for a short excursion to a scenic natural feature. DEC maintains hiking trails on many areas of Forest Preserve lands in the Adirondack and Catskill Parks as well as on State Forests, Wildlife Management Areas and Unique Areas. Most trails are marked with color coded disks affixed to trees. Trail guides and maps corresponding to these markers have been developed for many locations. Trail register boxes are generally located near major access points and parking areas. Although most DEC-maintained trails are marked, hikers are encouraged to consult topographical maps or other guides when planning to venture into the backcountry. Information on hiking safety, rules, and etiquette Where to Go Trails Supporter Patch Protect Yourself Hiking trails can be rough and rugged - they are not maintained as park walkways - wear boots or shoes designed for hiking. Wearing sneakers, sandals, or other shoes on trails can be uncomfortable and may result in injuries. Know and plan for the route and terrain that you plan to hike and the conditions you may encounter. Map and compass Flashlight or headlamp Food and water Extra clothing First aid kit Keep together when hiking in groups - always have at least the person in front of you and the person behind you within your sight and all of the group within hearing distance.
Sign in and out of all trail registers that you encounter - for groups only one person
should sign in. Call the DEC Central Dispatch at 518-408-5852, or in the Adirondacks 518-891-0235, to report a lost, injured or stricken hiker or other backcountry emergency. Respect Others Be respectful and courteous towards your fellow adventurers by following trail etiquette: Be courteous of all other users regardless of their sport, speed or skill level. Hike in single file, especially when approaching other hikers. Stay to the right and pass on the left when safe and appropriate. Allow faster hikers to pass by. When coming up from behind politely make them aware of your presence and desire to pass. On narrow trails, yield to oncoming hikers. Hikers going downhill should yield to hikers going uphill. Hikers on foot bridges and bog bridging have the right of way, allow them to complete their crossing before stepping onto the bridge or other structure. Keep pets under control Enjoy and respect wildlife from a distance - do not disturb Park in designated parking areas - do not block gates, entrances, exits or other vehicles. Protect the Lands & Waters Know the rules of the area where you will be hiking. Don't litter - Carry out what you carry in. Do not remove or damage trail markers. Walk through, not around, mud and puddles on trails to avoid further eroding and widening trails. Stay off steep, high elevation trails during the spring mud season. After a hike and before getting into your vehicle shake or brush off clothing and clean boot treads to avoid spreading seeds of invasive species. More about Hiking:

Jenny Rough Jenny Rough September 16 at 8:00 AM Sarah Savage was alone in the woods and didn’t know which way to turn. She had been eager to explore the Appalachian Trail when she moved to Pennsylvania and discovered that her house was near an access point. But not long after she took off from the trailhead, the path branched in different directions. She wasn’t carrying a cellphone or a map. Nervous, she turned back. “I was afraid of getting lost. I didn’t know how to read a map or even that maps existed for where I was hiking,” said Savage, 49, who works in educational publishing. But she liked the physical and emotional benefits of being out there, so she kept going back. She brought a map and followed the trail as best she could, yet she still felt apprehensive. “I had no sense of direction,” she said. “I wasn’t paying attention to north, south, east or west.” While a database that Koester created shows 24,000 formal search-and-rescue efforts a year, it’s imprecise, he said, given that many hikers get lost for only a short time. “Many are able to eventually reorient themselves, or are lucky enough to stumble across someone else,” he said. But for some hikers, the wrong turn proves deadly. “The classic behavior when you get lost is to speed up,” said Jamie O’Donnell, a field instructor with the National Outdoor Leadership School, a nonprofit based in Wyoming. “People think, ‘Oh, I need to work hard to get myself out of this.’ In doing that, they often make the situation worse by hiking fast. They quit paying attention to terrain features.” Once you’ve stopped and replenished your body, you can think more clearly. “Then and only then, pull out your map,” Boone said. Although many trail users frequently rely on electronic prompts to provide a sense of direction, a GPS device is not a magic box, O’Donnell said. It’s important to understand its limitations. “The GPS won’t tell you there is a mountain in the way or there is a huge river that won’t be safe to cross, but a map will,” he said. GPS units break. Batteries go dead. Phones get dropped in streams. Also, “turn-by-turn GPS [navigation] in which you see only one route and are always going straight ahead” doesn’t teach people to situate themselves on a route, said Nora Newcombe, a cognitive psychologist at Temple University. “For the Inuit in a traditional lifestyle, it’s a more challenging task due to the relative lack of stable landmarks,” Newcombe said. “Thus, they use other clues such as the prevailing wind direction as shown in the snow.” Visual clues can also help you stay safe and oriented on the trail. Some hikers set their trekking poles outside their tent at night pointing in the direction they’re supposed to go the next morning, Boone said, while others never hike alone. Some go so far as to place their pack on the side of the trail, tie a string to it and carry the string with them when going off to use the bathroom. O’Donnell said that when he is in an area with lots of splits and turns, he’ll draw an arrow in the dirt at each junction in case he needs to backtrack. The arrows serve as a visual record if he gets confused or disoriented. He says he does this rarely, only when he needs to make a series of directional decisions prompted by many forks or other choices. And hikers should always make a plan. “Let someone know you’re going out and when you’ll be back,” said Brian Schachter, an instructor at the Baltimore Chesapeake Bay Outward Bound School. “If you’re not back by that time, they know to contact authorities.” “My concern is that when people get these devices, there’s an excuse to push the envelope because their confidence isn’t in their skills, it’s in their equipment,” Boone said. “I planned it to within an inch of its life,” she said. “I knew where I was starting, where I was ending, and where I was going to camp every single night.” But she still relied on guidebook descriptions to follow her route. “I had no clue about topography or contour lines, so I never ever ventured off well-marked, obvious trails,” she said. When she began hiking out west where trails often vanished above the tree line, she relied on her boyfriend, who knew how to read maps. “He would take the lead and I’d follow him.” Frustrated with that, Savage decided to learn map-and-compass skills herself. “I’m slow at it,” she said of the navigation exercises she practiced in one of Boone’s classes. Savage may not be fast, but when she hiked a section of the Continental Divide Trail alone last year, she stayed the course — with the help of a map.

Hike the Hudson Valley Hike the Hudson Valley Main menu Home The Hikes Store FAQ Leave No Trace Alander Mountain Super-cool Google Earth flyover of hike route:   Google Terrain Map of hike route: The summit of Alander Mountain is unique for this area in that there’s no one place you can point to and say, “This is the best spot to take in the view.”  The grass, rocks and low bushes along the trail at the summit allow you to stop wherever you’d like, grab a seat and create your own personal money spot. For all the beauty you’ll find here, you won’t be bothered by crowds, unless perhaps you’re competing for a spot in the cabin near the summit.  Actually, that’s been empty both times I’ve been up here, so maybe crowds aren’t an issue there, either. On the sunny spring day when I was here last, there were a few people lazing about near the summit, but not nearly as many as there should have been.  This is a gorgeous hike that should be high on your to-do list if you’re willing to burn a few (thousand) calories to earn some awesome views.     1.  From the parking area, head downhill along the road for a couple hundred yards, back to the trailhead on your right.  Careful on the side of the road – if I’m not mistaken, that is one of the biggest fields of poison ivy I’ve ever seen (this is the only spot I noticed any poison ivy along the hike). 2.  From the trailhead, which is clearly marked with several signs on a tree facing the road, hop on the blue-blazed Alander Brook Trail.  Only 2.5 miles from here to the junction with Alander Mountain Trail at the summit?  Piece of cake!  Strenuous, strenuous cake. 3.  For the first mile or so, the trail is pretty flat.  Enjoy it while you can.  In just a couple of minutes, after taking in the nice view across the field to your left, you’ll come to the junction with the Robert Brook Trail, which is marked by a tree that is eating the sign. Turn left here to stay on the Alander Brook Trail.  This is the beginning of the loop – you’ll come back down via the Robert Brook Trail later, when you’re much more tired and sweaty. 4.  In 10-15 minutes, you’ll cross over a culvert (which is what you call those big honking metal pipes, according to the Internet) that directs Alander Brook under the trail.  Directly after this culvert, make a hard right to stay on the Blue Trail.  If you went straight/left here, which looks logical, you’d end up on a Spur Trail to Nowhere, so try not to do that.  (The picture on the left was taken after I’d already crossed the culvert, so that’s the view looking back.) UPDATE 11/6/2016 6.  Shortly after the culvert, the trail reminds you that you are, indeed, climbing a mountain.  The next junction to look for is with the white-blazed South Taconic Trail. It took us 30 minutes to get to that junction from the culvert, including stops to take pictures of salamanders. 7.  When you arrive at the South Taconic Trail, which joins you from the left (careful you don’t stroll past it!), you’ll have climbed about 700 feet from the parking area.  You might want to take a breather at this junction, because the South Taconic Trail isn’t going to take it any easier on you. After you’ve caught your breath, take a left to head uphill on the South Taconic Trail.  You’ll take a few steps up the bank, then curve right with the trail at the tree with the “South Taconic Trail” sign on it. 8.  You have about 500 vertical feet to climb until you’ll pop out into some awesome views.  Just keep trudging up the South Taconic Trail and all your hard work will be rewarded soon.  From the Alander Brook/South Taconic trail junction, it took me about 25 minutes to get to the views, slogging slowly along, wondering how my two-year-old could possibly weigh 300 pounds. 9.  And all of a sudden, there they are.  Those views. 10.  Keep making your way up the trail, stopping often to look at the view behind you.  There’s no one place along this several-hundred-yard length of trail that is the “best” place to take in the view.  If you see a spot that looks good for a picnic or break, by all means, plunk down and gaze into the distance for a while.   11.  On your left, after some more steep climbing, you might notice a sign that tells you you’ve come .8 miles (that’s all?) from the Alander Brook Trail.  Only 1,000 more feet to go until the next trail junction. UPDATE September 2016 13.  Optional step: Turn left to head north on the South Taconic Trail and see some different views.  This will add about 20 minutes of hiking to your day, and it will be up-and-back, returning you to this spot.  If you want to see them, turn left and head through the thick underbrush for a few hundred yards, stopping when you get to a small, rocky and grassy clearing.  The views here aren’t earth-shattering compared to what you’ve just seen, but they’d be a destination on any other mountain.  After you’ve taken them in, return to the junction with the sign sticking out of the rock cairn.   If you’re running low on energy, you shouldn’t feel like you’re missing out on too much if you skip this step.  I skipped it the last time I was here.  The 5.4-mile length for this hike does NOT include this optional step. 14.  From the junction with the rock cairn, facing the sign as if you’ve just arrived from Step 12 above (whether you did the optional step or not), turn right to head toward the “MASS. PARK HQ”.  Goodbye for now, South Taconic Trail!  See you again soon. 15.  In just a moment, you’ll see a cabin through the trees.  Head down the bank to pay it a visit.  From what I can tell, this place is first-come, first-served, and free.  Since there’s no camping allowed up here otherwise, the wooden bunks in this cabin look like the only option for sleeping on Alander Mountain. 16.  From the front door of the cabin, look back uphill, the way you just came down.  Straight ahead, you’ll see a sign directing you to the right for the Alander Mt. Trail, Alander Mt. Summit and South Taconic Trail.  You could retrace your steps to return to your car back this way if you’d like, but I like a good loop, and the way we’ll take down also has some nice views (it’s about the same distance either way). Walk up to that sign and turn left, into the Great Unknown.  Or at least the Great Unmentioned on That Sign, since it doesn’t say what happens when you go left. **UPDATE June 2016** A friend of mine got lost at this spot, so I’d like to make sure we’re absolutely crystal clear on the directions here.  Face the front door of the cabin.  Now turn RIGHT, and head back the way you came, very briefly.  In just a moment, you should the see sign pictured just above, with three arrows pointing right.  At this sign, turn LEFT.  (If you were to make a left turn while facing the front door of the cabin, you’d end up descending Mt. Alander on the wrong side, coming, several miles later, to the Mt. Washington St. Forest HQ in Massachusetts, which is what my friend did.  Her group found a nice hiker to drive them back to their car at the other trailhead, a twenty-minute drive, which was very fortunate and cool of that hiker.  But let’s do our best to have you avoid hitchhiking today, shall we?)
17.  “Dude, seriously?” you might be asking yourself right about now, as the single-track, blue-blazed trail makes its way through a dense mountain laurel thicket.  I promise, the going gets much easier in just a few minutes.  You’re now on the Alander Loop Trail, preparing to make a well-deserved descent. 18.  About five minutes after turning onto the Alander Loop Trail, you’ll come to a small clearing with limited views.  If you haven’t already stopped for lunch or a snack, this is probably your best bet for the rest of the hike, even though you can’t see the views when you’re sitting. 19.  Keep heading down the blue-blazed Alander Loop Trail.  Just when you thought you were done with views for the day, you get some more. 20.  You’ll keep losing altitude for a solid half-hour after that small clearing with limited views, then the Alander Loop Trail dead-ends into the white-blazed South Taconic Trail.  Turn left to go gently uphill along the South Taconic Trail.  Does the South Taconic Trail ever go downhill? 21.  The trickiest junction of the entire hike is coming up in about 10-15 minutes.  It’s a right turn onto the red-blazed Robert Brook Trail.  Keep a sharp eye out for it – if you weren’t paying attention, it’d be easy to stroll right past it.  If you looking for it, though, you shouldn’t have a problem – there are plenty of blazes. When you see those dark red blazes, turn right onto the Robert Brook Trail.  If you miss the turn, enjoy the summit of Brace Mountain in about two miles or so!  No, but seriously, don’t miss the turn. 22.  Thankfully, you’re headed downhill again.  About five minutes after you turn onto the Robert Brook Trail, you’ll pass a concrete NY/MA state line marker. 23.  In another five minutes, you’ll pass another one, for some reason.  We like our state borders clearly marked, indeed we do. Directly after that second marker, be sure to take a right to stay on the Robert Brook Trail.  I’m not sure where that trail coming in from the left goes, but it’s definitely not to your car. 24.  Keep steadily descending, giving away all that altitude you worked so hard to earn.  It took us 40 minutes from the start of the Robert Brook Trail to reach the eponymous Robert Brook.  Once you cross that brook, you’re very close to the finish line. 25.  Less than ten minutes after crossing the stream (probably much less – my son wanted out of the bag, so he walked the rest of the way to the car from here, throwing off my time estimates a bit), you’ll arrive back at the junction with the sign-eating tree.  Hooray! 26.  Take a left to head back down the short trail to the road. 27.  At the road, go left to return to your car.  Watch for traffic!  And wait to collapse until you’re past all the poison ivy.  Phew!  You made it.  I hope you have something delicious for dinner tonight.  Those calories aren’t going to replace themselves.         Was this trail guide useful to you?  Please leave a comment!

<p> Alander Mountain SWJ said: If you were to do this hike in reverse (counter clockwise): I
noticed that there’s a sign on the southern end of the blue, Alander Loop, trail where it ‘dead ends’ in step 20, saying that the trail is closed and advising to ascend Alander Mtn using the South Taconic Trail.
No explanation as to why.
Sorry, I didn’t think to snap a photo.
I don’t know if there’s a similar sign up at the northern end of the trail. 0 ↓ Kelly said: I noticed that too.
Did the hike today and it was awesome!
I saw that sign on the way down, but there was not one at the top.
I used NYNJTC map 107 and it helped, particularly around the cabin junction.
Great time but this was definitely a challenging hike for me.
Quite steep up and down, but Ioved it.
Would be amazing in the fall. 0 ↓ Brendan said: Great TR! I’m hoping to head out there next weekend (April 29th). I’m actually hoping to come across some rattlers to photograph; has anyone come across them this early in the season? Just for fun, I’ve included a photo of a copperhead I took last week in Connecticut. 1 ↓ Mike said: Hi Brendan!
I heard from a friend who saw a rattler at Minnewaska about a week ago, so they are apparently out and about in the area.
(The snake didn’t even rattle as he gently nudged it off the trail with a long stick – he took a video of the proceedings, and the snake seemed awfully mellow about the whole thing.)
I’ve never seen a copperhead before, and hope to keep that streak going.
Thanks for the nice pic – hope you had plenty of zoom on that lens, and I hope any rattlers you find have pleasant dispositions! 0 ↓ Cathy said: Hi–I just got back from trying this hike, and had some difficulty at Step 5. We came to a junction with the blue X on the tree, looked at your directions which said to keep going straight, and continued straight on a trail that was a bit overgrown. We hiked for quite a long time, unable to find the South Taconic Trail turnoff.
After awhile, fearful we had screwed up, we headed back the way we had come. At the junction where the tree with the X is, I tried the other trail (which would have been a right turn at the junction not “straight”), and eventually saw a blue blaze on a tree. Eureka! By now it was getting too late to continue, but I assume this is the correct way? I would suggest changing the directions to indicate that you bear right at the intersection with the Blue X. We have enjoyed using your maps and love the photos. Keep it up! 0 ↓ Mike said: Cathy, I’m so sorry to hear this.
Looking back over the directions above, I’m pretty sure things went off the rails on Step 4.
Here’s what the trail guide says: “Directly after this culvert, make a hard right to stay on the Blue Trail.
If you went straight/left here, which looks logical, you’d end up on a Spur Trail to Nowhere, so try not to do that.”
If you thought you were on Step 5 at that point, you would have been looking at these instructions: “You might notice another trail joining from the left, with a big blue X on the tree to tell you not to go that way.
Take that X’s advice and keep heading straight/uphill on the Blue Trail.”
It sounds to me like you probably ended up on the Spur Trail to Nowhere mentioned in Step 4.
Does that sound like the right prognosis?
Is there anything I could change in the text that would have helped to avoid this problem?
Hope you have a better run at it next time, and I hope we can help others to avoid the same fate! 0 ↓ Cathy said: Hi Mike–Actually I did make
the hard right to stay on the blue trail after the culvert. There was a sort of big climb after that and then I arrived at the intersection With the X on the tree.mentioned. At that point, we would have to turn right again to stay on the blue trail (left would turn us toward the tree with the X). This is where we goofed…your directions said keep “straight/uphill” so we went straight. I think the directions would be correct if you said, at the junction, bear right uphill on the blue trail. I plan to try the hike again, so will take some photos to clear up what I mean. Thanks for your response. 0 ↓ Mike said: This is very helpful, Cathy – thank you!
I just updated Step 5 above with a warning to make sure nobody else hits this same problem.
Let me know if that doesn’t do the trick! 0 ↓ na said: How come the red dots on the map don’t say which junction it is?
It’s completely unclear which way you ascended and descended. The map I’m looking at from the Mt Washington SF government site does not even show an “Alander loop trail”… this is utter #$%^ 0 ↓ Mike said: Pleasure to meet you, na!
When I first created this site, the Everytrail.com maps that I’d create from my GPS data would include waypoint labels and animations of the hike route.
For some reason, Everytrail made changes that removed the animations and stripped out the waypoint labels (hence the red pins with no text).
I agree that it’s less than ideal.
For this hike, I just scrapped the Everytrail link and created a new Google map that includes the waypoint labels — try clicking the link in the “GPS Goodies” section above and see if you don’t find it more useful now.
You can also read the (perhaps too copious) text above to figure out which way I tackled this hike. Hope this all helps you to have a nice adventure out there.
Thanks for stopping by! 0 ↓ Unavailable said: Thank you, lol. I became frustrated trying to puzzle together the way went through reading your account and going back and forth with the red dots. Perhaps my reading comprehension is not what it once was, but I was almost sure that you took the other way up and the left turn near the ny/mass border was where you picked up the STC in step 7.
But then I realized the steps didn’t
in anyway correspond to the red dots and I had no idea of which way you went up. In any event great site and interesting accounts. By the way, I know you know this but you were in the heart of timber rattler territory with dens close by when you sat on that rock on the loop trail for a break. But I’m sure you kept a close eye on the kid, what an experience he’s lucky to have had at such a young age.
I have one last question, in your opinion which of these mountains has the best views? I have time to hike maybe two this fall (I don’t live close by) I know this is relative but as far as views would you choose: Alander, Brace, Race, Bear, Frissell, or Everett?
I’m leaning toward Alander and Race, and Bear my third option if I have the time. Are Braces best views toward the Catskills rather than the rest of the Taconics? Maybe Bear should replace Race? What say you my Toddler toting, unafraid of sitting next to rattlesnakes for a break, South Taconic Mountain expert? 0 ↓ Mike said: Thanks for the nice follow-up, Unavailable!
I just added a timber rattler warning to my two Alander trail guides, just to make sure everyone knows to step carefully out there.
As for ranking the views in the Taconics, I would recommend Brace (via the South Taconic Trail – listed as Brace Mountain II on this site), then Alander (via either route), then Race (which I did last year and will write up one of these days – beautiful hike, but the view isn’t as good as Brace or Alander).
I haven’t done Bear or Everett, and Frissell doesn’t have much of a view.
Hope that helps! 0 ↓ not applicable said: Thank you that definitely helps with my decision, I have a hard time with those. 1 Sandy said: Did this hike about a week ago–as you put it so succinctly–great views, steep climb! I just want to point out that the sign mentioned in Steps 12-14 (the sign sticking out of the rock cairn) is in bad shape.
When we got there it was in pieces; only 1 piece that was barely hanging on was still attached & it was hanging at an angle with arrows in the wrong direction. It was impossible to use that sign as it was for directions. You wisely tell folks to go right to continue the loop when they get to that junction.
I would just reiterate it here–don’t worry about what the sign says, or which way it appears to be pointing–just go right at that junction.
Btw, met some NYNJ Trail Conference folks on the way down & told them about the sign.
They said they were aware but with so many signs to maintain, don’t know when they’ll get to it. (The pic I posted of the sign is after I picked up a fallen piece & kind of leaned it next to the attached piece) 2 ↓ Mike said: Thank you, Sandy!
I’ve just updated the trail guide at Step 12 with a link down to your comment.
Very much appreciated! 0 ↓ Keerthana said: This is so awesome! I wish I had seen this before doing this hike yesterday. I took the alander trail, went past the south taconic, into the white traill, then switched to blue trail. We reached at the cabin, and continued upwards to the summit. The summit was a big tease as there was a breathtaking view after every big ascent we took however it was not the top so we kept going up and up forever. But got to say, the almost 360 degree view at the summit was worth every bit. On our way back, we had a visitor, a black timber rattle snake (around 1.5 feet) right on the middle of the trail path. It was quite an experience. I definitely plan on going back, to try a different trail to the mount.
Your record of the trails are amazing , it will definitely help me when I go back. Thank you !!! 🙂 2 ↓ Amanda said: Just want to say thank you. I followed this post to a “T” today. I didn’t miss a single turn. Loved the pictures and landmarks! You doing this with a kid made it feel super attainable. Took me 3 hours to do the loop. Stopped at the cabin to have lunch. Great day man. Thanks for helping me have the confidence in the trails. Met 2 Rattlesnakes today on the trails, super cool. 4 ↓ Danit said: Just a quick thank – you . Your instructions were very helpful. 3 ↓ nyebone said: I did this hike yesterday, altho in the opposite direction.I got quite confused near the cabin by the sign pointing to the summit. This is contradictory to the summit location on my NYNJ trail map, hence the confusion. I needed my compass to figure out which direction to continue (south). Perhaps I’m getting a little senile, at age 63 w 50 years hiking experience. Anyhoo… a wonderful hike thanks for posting it on your GREAT website. 1 ↓ John said: 0 ↓ John said: John, you seriously need to listen to my advice about posting after/while you’re imbibing 0 ↓ Ricky said: Thanks for the great guide. I plan on trying this weekend. Is it possible to take the blue trail all the way up? I’m a bit confused by the directions, why do you not turn towards the arrow pointing to the summit? 0 ↓ Mike said: Hope you have a great trip, Ricky!
You COULD finagle a trip to the top using only the Blue Trail, but that would be a different hike than the one outlined above, and I’ve never tried it before.
If you’re referring to Step 16 above, you turn away from the summit because, at that point, you’ve already visited the summit, so you turn left there to continue along the loop.
I hope this is helpful!
Let me know if I didn’t answer your question. 0 ↓ Jay said: Pardon meh, but is there directions to the trailhead parking on this page? 0 ↓ Jay said: delete delete found them sorry on the other page Alander II the directions were at the top 1 ↓ Jay said: oh no they weren’t they were at the bottom. haha good stuff, I should start smoking weed again it makes me more perceptive. 1 ↓ Jay said: Thanks for the detailed directions on your hike reviews, extremely helpful. 1 ↓ MBow said: It poured out so I guess he was sun bathing, he wasn’t aggressive or anything but god was he big! and he was also blocking our path, we ended up having to cut through the brush to get around him. 0 ↓ Mike said: Thanks for the heads-up!
Seems like this area, including Brace Mountain, is not in any danger of running out of rattlesnakes anytime soon.
In my experience, bumping into a rattlesnake is one of those things that’s very cool in retrospect.
Glad you didn’t get any better acquainted with him than you did. For the sign issue, please let me know if an update to the guide above could be helpful to help others avoid the same fate.
Thanks for taking time to drop a comment, MBow! 0 ↓ MBow said: It shouldn’t be a major problem for anyone as long they know how to tell North/South/East/West We were just so confused when we looked at the sign and south was north and north was south. We should have just listened to instinct really but we followed the sign and later realized it was totally turned around. But yea, the rattlesnake was beautiful for sure. Definitely a bit alarming but a fun time, I want to go back and try and get Brace Mountain done by the end of the fall. 1 ↓ Jacquelyn Pierce said: Thanks so much for the detailed guide! Without you I would of been very lost. 🙂 0 ↓ Jim Hall said: Mike, Hi, first off – thanks for all of the work that you have done on all of the trails.
I have hiked more than five this summer and fall – all of your trail advise has been very helpful.
I am thinking of hiking Alander Mt. this weekend and would like your opinion on the possible conditions.
Do you know if anyone has tried this late in the year.
Any advise would be appreciated.
thanks, Jim 1 ↓ Mike said: Hi Jim, Glad to hear the site has been useful for you!
I’ve never tried it this late in the year, and especially after the snowfall we got last night, along with fallen leaves, I’d expect the trail conditions to be pretty dicey and more difficult to follow.
If you have experience with this kind of thing, it’d be beautiful up there, but my blanket recommendation would be that it might be better to wait until spring, or at least until we have a good long dry/warm(ish) stretch.
Good luck if you give it a go! 0 ↓ Jim Hall said: Mike, Thanks for information.
I think I might try Brace Mt.
I am hopeful that you did not get that much snow ‘up north’ – I live in Westchester – and that today’s temps melt what ever you did get.
I don’t plan on pushing it if the conditions look that bad.
I just need to get out and have done all of the difficult hikes nearer to me.
I will let you if I make it and what the conditions were like.
Thanks again for your hard work on this website.
I love it and have recommended to many friends. Jim 0 ↓ Clayton H. said: 0 ↓ Mike said: Thanks, Clayton!
I ran into a rattler on nearby Brace Mountain, and I don’t recall finding the humor in the whole thing until way, way later.
They’re apparently all over the place in the Taconics.
Step carefully out there, everyone! 0 ↓ Jay said: I couldn’t believe how much it will cost for the large doses of anti-venom for the timber rattler bite, considering that you need ~20-40 times the dosage amount for other rattlers.
Does anyone have any personal recommendations for a good snake bite kit? I like to hear from people who have actually had to use them, kind of hard to find those types of reviews, which I guess is good in a sense. 0 ↓ Chris said: 0 ↓ Mike said: Not sure why I didn’t reply to this comment long ago, but thanks so much for the kind words and useful info, Chris!
Very much appreciated. 0 ↓ Kelsey said: Hi Mike, I’m with a university outdoors club and we want to do some hiking in the area this Saturday, March 1st. Do you know if there is too much snow? Are trails open and would crampons be necessary? Thanks! 0 ↓ Mike said: Hi Kelsey!
Your comment prompted me to update this page with a link to the Mt. Washington State Forest HQ homepage – the old page had become a broken link that I’d deleted.
I’ve never done this hike in the winter, and am not sure of the trail conditions at the moment, but would venture a guess that they are fairly gnarly.
Even in warm weather, this is a tough hike.
Please give the park HQ a call and see what advice they have for you there – the number given on their homepage is (413) 528-0330.
Hope that helps – have a great trip, and take lots of pictures! 0 ↓ Tracy said: My friend and I decided to take a hike up there yesterday around 3:15. Not really paying attention to the time or thinking about what time the sun would be setting. Thanks to your very detailed descriptions and spot on times we were able to navigate our way down after the sun had set. Thank you for providing beautiful pictures and a thorough description of what to look for! The hike kicked our butts but was so worth it! Thanks again! 0 ↓ Mike said: So glad you made it down safely!
Hope you have many more great adventures out there, perhaps with slightly less excitement. 0 ↓ Paul Wimmer said: Hi we just hiked the trail today. Your website helped tremendously thank you. We got down following the loop, not sure exactly how but we did. Along the way down we encountered a 3ft timber rattler. Very cool well at least i thought so. I have a question though. At the top we came across a military ammo box. My son and daughter were very intrigued by it. There was definitely something inside of it but we chose not to open it. Just curious if you know anything about it. It was pretty much out in the open. Thanks Paul 0 ↓ Mike said: Hi Paul, Hope this is helpful — thanks for taking the time to comment! Mike 0 ↓ Jessica said: 0 ↓ Mike said: Hi Jessica!
That’s a good question.
I got that number (1,822′) from my hiking GPS, which records all the ups and downs during the hike.
If you click the first link in the “GPS goodies” section at the top of this page — the one that says “Google Terrain map” — you’ll see an overlay of the elevation profile for this hike, including the little upward jog between mile 3 and 4 that should account for a good percentage of that extra 400 ft (if you’re using a mobile device to click that link, you won’t see the elevation profile – it needs to be a regular laptop/desktop browser). Hope that helps, and I hope you and the scouts have a great trip! 0 ↓ Kelly said: Do you have an address for the parking area at the start of the trail? 0 ↓ Mike said: Hi Kelly,
Just the intersection I gave in the “Sorta nearby address for your GPS” section above, which should work for putting into Google Maps or a GPS device, and will get you really close – the “Directions to the trailhead” section gives more details, too.
(There’s a house right across the street, but it seems weird for me to post private addresses to this site, so I generally don’t do it.) Hope that helps!
Let me know if you still can’t find it.
Have fun out there if you check this one out! Mike 0 ↓ Kimberly Kilbride said: On step four, it says that if you go straight, it’s a dead end. Tonight we accidentally missed the turn off and went straight. That way, albeit probably longer, is a gentle carriage way esque trail right to the top of the Alander Trail. Basically, the blue trail is shorter, but if you want to save your knees a bit for the descent, you can head straight and end up there anyway. Either way the hike was amazing, and your trail guide, a usual, was helpful in negotiating it. 0 ↓ Mike said: Thanks, Kimberly!
That’s good to know – never tried that way.
And thanks for the kind words.
Very much appreciated.
Glad you had a good day out there! 0 ↓ Your email address will not be published. * * * * Recent Comments Andrey Breakneck Ridge Breakneck to Close for Repairs - http://highlandscurrent.com/2017/09/15/breakneck-close-repairs/ Sep 15, 15:28 A Surprise Lake II (via Greenwood Lake overlook) We got there before 10 am and the parking was fine.

Whether you want a quiet walk on the beach or a challenging hill climb, you'll find some of the best hiking in Washington State in the San Juan Islands
Walking in a quiet forest of Douglas fir and Western Red Cedar, you find that your cares fall away. In the San Juan Islands, you'll find hiking trails along beautiful rocky bluffs, or driftwood covered beaches, past historic lighthouses and stunning vistas of little islands dotting the Salish Sea. Choose your level of difficulty, from easy walks to challenging climbs in many different landscapes on countless nature preserves and public lands.   Mount Constitution From the summit, you’ll have 360-degree views of the San Juan Islands, Vancouver, and the mainland, bracketed by snow-tipped Mt. Baker and Mt. Rainier. Enjoy an added touch of historical interest in the watchtower, built from hand-cut stone by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1936. If you have small children or just fancy something less strenuous, there are a multitude of easier hikes farther down the mountain. Or arrange to be dropped off at the top and have someone pick you up at the bottom for a leisurely downhill hike. There is a paved road all the way up Mount Constitution, so consider parking partway up for a leisurely and beautiful three-mile stroll around Mountain Lake—you can even jump in for a cooling swim. Beyond Mountain Lake, trails lead out to Cascade Falls and Twin Lakes. With over 38 miles of trails, 5,200-acre Moran State Park offers something for every fitness level.   Turtleback Mountain For those less inclined to pant up an exposed climb, choose the north ascent. Here, conifer forest and wetlands replace the grasslands and Garry oaks of the south face. Obstruction Pass State Park Orcas Blakely Find maps of more Orcas Island hikes.   Hiking Lovely Lopez Island   Hummel Lake Preserve Located on the south end of Lopez Island’s largest freshwater lake, 80-acre Hummel Lake Preserve boasts beautiful lakefront shoreline, a dock for fishing (but no swimming), and about a mile of trails through a second-growth forest that ends at Port Stanley Road.   Lopez Hill Fuca   Agate Beach Agate Beach is on the southernmost tip of Lopez Island, with an amazing view of the water and Iceberg Point, part of the new San Juan Islands National Monument lands. At low tide, a sandy beach is accessible. Donated to the County by Seth Richey in 1948, the is one of Lopez Island's most beautiful spots.  Shark Reef Sanctuary Don’t miss the Shark Reef Sanctuary on the west side of the island, where a short 10-minute walk through a forest will lead to a rocky shoreline where you’ll get views over the water and an almost certain seal (and perhaps sea lion and otter) sighting—just be sure to follow the path around to the left. Find more maps of Lopez Island hikes.   San Juan Island's Best HIkes   Young Hill The trail rises at a steady gradient, with plenty of places for you to stop, catch your breath, and drink in the views, which get more and more rewarding as you climb. The forest of evergreens, madrones, and oaks thins to a clearing at the summit. You’ll see several varieties of wildflowers in the spring. If you’ve brought lunch, settle down and enjoy some of the best views in the area. You have the world at your feet. Lime Kiln Point State Park The park, which features a richly diverse environment, includes the remnants and landscapes of a history filled with change, along the rocky shoreline and through the wooded uplands. Minke whales, porpoises, seals, sea lions, otters and bald eagles also cruise the shoreline. The lighthouse was built in 1919 and still serves as a navigational beacon for ships in the Haro Strait. Interpretive programs, an interpretive center with gift shop and lighthouse tours are available during the summer months.   South Beach South Beach in American Camp National Historical Park is the longest public beach in the islands, with views over the Strait of Juan de Fuca to the Olympic Mountains. All along this pristine two-mile pebble-and-sand beach, a wide swath of massive driftwood has washed up and been bleached in the sun for decades. A wonderful place to take photos, enjoy a brisk walk for exercise, or a slow stroll for beachcombing, South Beach also has broad golden hills where eagles and hawks reel, rabbits forage and red foxes hunt at sunset, a historic “redoubt” or temporary fortification made during the Pig War conflict between the American and English troops from 1859 to 1871 – a standoff during which no shots were fired. Now, the only flames you’ll see are the summer bonfires at sunset as locals and visitors gather to enjoy this stunning and special place. Jakle's Lagoon & Mount Finlayson At 295 feet, this is not a challenging climb, although a few sections run a little steep. With South Beach, Jakle’s Lagoon, and Fourth of July Beach nearby, this hike fits very well into a day of south-end sightseeing.  From the Jakle’s Lagoon parking lot and trailhead, you can start at either end of the loop trail. Head right on the wide Mount Finlayson Trail, which climbs gradually across golden grasslands lined by wind-blasted, contorted firs paralleling Cattle Point Road. The trail crests on the long ridge of Mount Finlayson, named for one of the founders of Victoria, B.C., which you can see from along the trail. At 1.3 miles a trail leads left, near a group of large firs—your return route. But walk a bit farther for a grand view of Cattle Point Lighthouse. (Watch for eagles, plovers, sandpipers and hawks.) Loop back down into a cool forested ravine to reach a trail junction at Third Lagoon after 0.25 mile. Turn left onto an old woods road, 1.75 miles back to the trailhead. Or at the parking lot, take the wide trail through the cool evergreen forest to the summit, then follow the high, open ridge and hike down the mountain back to the parking lot. From the summit you’ll have spectacular views across Haro and Juan de Fuca Straits to the Olympic Mountains and Vancouver Island.  Watch for whales in these waters.

Hike the Hudson Valley Hike the Hudson Valley Main menu Home The Hikes Store FAQ Leave No Trace Breakneck Ridge It is extremely difficult, though, and I’d be very hesitant to recommend this hike for small children.  I’ve done most of the hikes in Hike the Hudson Valley with a baby on my back, but I’d never attempt that here.  And I’d only bring a dog that I could carry. I didn’t see any other dogs there that day, but a fellow hiker assured me that she sees dogs here all the time.  There were several spots where my pooch Memphis needed a boost, and I honestly don’t see how a dog would get over some of those spots without being picked up and placed on top of the rocks. The point I’m trying to make: This hike is steep. It is also gorgeous and unforgettable.  If you have a chance to pay a visit to Breakneck Ridge, don’t pass it up.  And if you don’t have a chance, you should probably make one anyway. Trail guide: 2.  Climb up and over the tunnel that runs over Rt 9D, following the White Trail markers. 4.  Enjoy the view toward the river, and try not to think too much about what’s waiting behind you. Oops, you thought about it, didn’t you?  Oh well, might as well start climbing again.  Just keep following those white markers. There are a few spots where you can choose steeper or less steep options, which you’ll see marked with an X pointing left and right. See that guy on the cliff in the picture above?  He was heading down, and when he popped out beside a rock to my left (I was looking right – he surprised me), I realized that the trail was less steep the way he came down.  That guy saved me at least one dog-carry. 5.  Keep climbing, and the flagpole becomes a distant memory. 6.  Take some time to enjoy the next cliff overlook. 7.  Keep climbing, and eventually, this mountain will run out of bluffs to throw at you.  Really, it will.  When it feels like you’re at the top and you can’t see any more bluffs in front of you, you’re probably there.  You’ll have traveled about a mile, though it seems more like ten.  The next three miles on the loop fly by in comparison. At the top, above a couple of nice little pine trees, enjoy the view and munch a granola bar or two, if you packed ‘em. 8.  It wouldn’t be a bad hike to just go straight back down the White Trail from here.  That’s really where the best views are.  Most hikers like a good loop, though, so if that applies to you, let’s keep trekking.  (Also, the rest of the loop doesn’t require any dog-carrying.  The thought of carrying my dog back down some of those White Trail sections again was enough to keep us pressing forward.) 9.  In the small saddle after the last big bluff, ignore the Yellow Trail as it departs to your right.  Keep heading straight on the White Trail. 10.  You’re looking for a turnoff on your left to the Red Trail, after you pass one last small summit and a little marsh on your right (the frogs were going nuts in there when we walked past in late March – I thought we were coming upon a flock of turkeys.  Also, the Internet tells me that I should have said “a rafter of turkeys,” but somehow that seems like the only way to talk about turkeys and be pretentious at the same time.) The turnoff to the Red Trail is very tough to miss.  The only thing it’s lacking is a flashing light, and perhaps some sort of siren.  When you see it, take a left. 11.  Follow the Red Trail (aka the “Breakneck Bypass”) down a much more gradual descent through the woods, with occasional northerly views of Sugarloaf and the river. 12.  After 30-60 minutes, depending on how leisurely you’re strolling, the Red Trail dead-ends into the Wilkinson Memorial Trail, marked in yellow.  Take a left onto the Yellow Trail and keep following it downhill. 13.  The Yellow Trail continues its gradual descent for 15 minutes or so, ending abruptly and dumping you unceremoniously onto Route 9D, which can be a pretty busy road. Normally, I hate road hikes, and don’t consider a loop trail that has a large road section to be much of a loop.  But you can actually see the parking area from the dump-out point, so we’ll let this one slide, especially since it kept us from having to carry our dogs back down the mountain. Take a left onto Route 9D and walk carefully on the well-worn path beside it. 14.  Carefully cross the street once you get back to your car.  Boom!  You did it.  Congratulations on knocking out one of the toughest hikes in the area.  Now find someone to show all your awesome pictures.       Was this trail guide useful to you?  Please leave a comment!

<p> Breakneck Ridge Andrey said: 0 ↓ Josh said: Did this hike today (a Wednesday). While the parking lots filled up, I got there early enough to avoid craziness hiking up and it appeared that most hikers either turned around at the flagpole or returned down the yellow (Undercliff) trail before reaching the summit. The signs at the trailhead don’t lie: this definitely is “NOT a walk in the park”, but it’s not particularly tiring, as the immediate rock scrambles force you to set a slow pace. A little over a mile from trailhead to summit and it’s mostly rock scrambling. I’m a 22 year old in decent shape and the loop took me 3 1/4 hours, including a stop at the flagpole and lunch at the summit; 2 hours of that was the ascent. A few notes I’d like to add: 1 ↓ Mike said: Thanks so much for the helpful updates, Josh!
Glad you had a great day out there.
(And I’ll second the plug for the Avenza Maps app — just used it for the first time on a different hike, and it is really great to know exactly where you are at all times.) 1 ↓ MICHAEL a MOOK said: hi
Normally we do the W-R-Y path and it takes about 2 hours.
If we want to go longer would we then do the W to Blue/white (dont turn at the red and then come back down the yellow)?
How much extra time do you think that will take? 0 ↓ Mike said: Hi Michael — I’ve never tried that route, but it looks like a nice option if you’re looking to do a longer hike (W-BW-B-Y(left)).
From the map, it looks to at least double the length of this hike, but the terrain shouldn’t be as gnarly once you’ve gained the initial elevation.
My irresponsible, shot-in-the-dark guesstimate: 6.5 hours total, or 2.5 additional hours onto however long it takes you to do the W-R-Y version.
Let me know how close I got if you give it whirl! 🙂 0 ↓ michael k said: I am planning to tackle this hike this sunday, but looks like it will be raining on friday and saturday.
Anyone know how the conditions would be after 2 days of rain.
Would it be safe enough to attempt? thanks! 4 ↓ Shirley Maloney said: Selling hot dogs at the tunnel is great 0 ↓ DOLLAR BILL said: Yesterday, I rode Metro North to Cold Spring and walked to the Breakneck trail head. Kind of a long hoss but not that bad really. And the views are nice along the way. Once through the tunnel, I took the white trail past the cut off and turned right on the Notch Trail (blue)…then the red trail and to another blue trail (Cornish) and all the way back to Stony Point where I spent a last hour exploring there. This is doable. For people considering taking the train to Cold Spring…you can walk to Breakneck and forgo the cab. I’m a healthy 66 years old and not even sore today. And of course, the views are multiple and spectacular. And there’s even a doozy AFTER the cutoff you’ll miss if you take the short version of the hike. 1 ↓ Mary said: Thanks for description of the trail. My 18 yr. old son wants to take some friends there, so I wanted to check it out. Looks amazing! 0 ↓ Bob Warsak said: 7 ↓ T. Drake said: First, from a local: thank you. Lots of us carry garbage bags as a matter of course, especially on Mondays. It’s depressing.
Worse now is the proliferation of graffiti. Robust discussion locally, but I seriously wish the parks department would step in. 4 ↓ Tony said: Beautiful and challenging hike. Major gripe is heavy crowds, severely eroded breakneck ridge and wilkenson memorial trails. I hiked from breakneck to beacon back in 05 on a holiday weekend and
not seeing that many people along the way. 9D wasn’t lined up with cars when I finished my hike like you see today. 2 ↓ Dave said: Go early and go often…
Hiked Breakneck today for the 2nd time this season and it was absolutely beautiful out. The first time I hiked this trail I was with the LADY! and about 100 other people who decided scrambling up the face of a mountain would be a good idea. While the firt trip up was great, having to wait for others to find their next move, and also having to navigate around people who decided they wanted to stop and look out at the Hudson before even reaching the flagpole, was frustrating at the least. I planned it better this time and got to the trail before 8am. I was one of 6 cars at the trail head when I arrived, and did not see anyone else on the trail till the 2nd lookout. It was absolutely beautiful. The Scramble is difficult. There are parts where it is fairly easy, but then there are parts where you will seriously hurt yourself if you lose footing or are scared to get your hands dirty on some mossy rock. While my first trip here didn’t feel as difficult as today, I think part of that was that I subconsciously followed the people in front of me, and was able to see where they grabbed and stepped.
Since I was alone and there wasn’t hardly any traffic, I was able to take a few moments on a few of the payoffs to just sit down and look out at the hudson river. It was also fun looking across the way at Storm King thinking “a few weeks ago I climbed that mountain and was looking back over here at Breakneck…” The way down wasn’t bad, but it was a bit slippery since there had been some rain last night.
All in all, I ended up seeing 3 people and a dog at one of the most popular hiking spots in the hudson valley, and was able to get in nearly 4 miles and a nice rest on the payoff in 2 and a half hours. When i was walking back to my car, the masses were finally starting to arrive and hit the trailhead. It made me really happy that I got up early rather than sleeping in. 3 ↓ Yuliya Semenova said: Hello guys,
I like to check out the map before I get on the trail. Which state park should I be checking out the map for which includes this trail? Thank you a bunch. 0 ↓ Mike said: Yuliya, Man, keeping the links on this site current is tough, especially when New York State switches its URLs around every year or so, just to keep me on my toes.
I’ve fixed the links above so that you no longer need to know which park to select – the links will take you right to a PDF trail map, just like they used to do.
(See the map link in Step 1 of the trail guide, or in the Related Resources section.) Hope that helps – thanks for the alert! Mike 0 ↓ Richard said: I’d like to go for a day hike from NYC but I’m without a car. Is it possible to come from Grand Central Station to Cold Springs and get a taxi from there to the trail head? Otherwise, is walking from Cold Springs train station to the trailhead the only other option? Thank you! 0 ↓ Matthew said: There is actually a stop at Breakneck Ridge a handful of times per day. Check the MetroNorth schedule to see the times. My buddy and I took the train there, hiked the trail, and ended up in Cold Springs, where we caught the MetroNorth back. 1 ↓ Rick Elezi said: We went here yesterday with my staff thinking we were doing the other one thats 7 rated.
So we werent full prepared.
Had some friends too so we were 13 in total.
One of my friends had a broken foot and had to do the whole thing with a stick.
It was hard but he is happy he did it.
We really enjoyed this hike and want to do it again.
With proper planning of course. 0 ↓ mook said: We love your site.
How much longer does it take to keep going up the white until it runs into the yellow. Another words skip the bypass?
Thanks again 0 ↓ Chase Hostler said: Hey Mike, I noticed you said your friend got to the trailhead from the cold springs station. Is that an easy walk?
I’m looking to do Breakneck this Friday but not sure that the Breakneck station is open that day, and looking for an alternative… 0 ↓ G said: Hi. I walked from the station to the trailhead before. I believe it’s around a 2.8 mile-walk. Easy on the way there but horrible on the way back especially if it’s hot. But overall, it’s fine. Hope this helps! 0 ↓ Mike said: Thanks for the info, G!
Chase, as G said, it would not be an easy walk.
Possible, yes, but not easy.
My buddy cheated by having me pick him up, and I drove us to the trailhead.
If Uber isn’t already in Cold Spring (I’m country folk, so I have no idea), seems like a ripe opportunity there.
You could probably make a living shuttling hikers from the Cold Spring station to the area’s various trailheads.
I just checked Google Maps, and G’s estimate looks about right — around 2.5+ miles from the train station to the Breakneck trailhead.
Good luck and enjoy, however you get there! 0 ↓ Chase said: Thanks Guys!
I think I’m going to try and find a cab or uber from the CS station.
Thinking of doing the white ridge trail up and taking the blue notch trail back to either the red to blue or yellow trails back into cold spring for a rewarding beer and burger.
Any suggestions of which of those two trails to take (R or Y)?
Any special sights?
I see ruins on the map..intriguing…. 0 ↓ Chase said: 0 Ceem said: Hi. Thanks again for your wonderful trail guides. Ive been to Storm King, Lake Minnewaska, Anthony’s Nose, Bull Hill, Mt Beacon, Bonticou Crags and Table rocks, Sam’s Point, Little Stony Point, Walkway over the Hudson and Croton Gorge Park all because of your very helpful guides! Ive been to Breakneck as well but i wanted to know, how do i find that old eerie tree? I know its weird but id love to go visit Breakneck Ridge again just to see that tree hehe! 1 ↓ Mike said: That’s quite a list, Ceem!
Awesome!
That’s really great to see – glad the site has been useful for you. As for the tree (I assume we’re talking about this one from the slideshow?), it was photo #512 from that day, and the photo in Step 12 above, showing the turn onto the Wilkinson Memorial Trail, is #514.
Given that I take about one photo every ten seconds out there, I’m guessing that old tree is somewhere very, very close to the turnoff.
(My buddy Rob noticed it – have to give him credit.)
Hope that helps!
You’ll have to share your own pic after you find that tree 🙂 0 ↓ Ceem said: Oh my, I feel terrible about not being specific about it and you had to go thru the slideshow. I actually saw the picture of the tree recently on Hike the Hudson Valley’s Facebook page but i couldn’t find it anymore. I have seen many others post that picture but no directions at all and I feel like I should go there too haha! Anyways, attached is the photo of tree I was talking about. No pressure though. It might not actually be along the trail. Thank you! 0 ↓ Mike said: Oh, of course!
Yes, that tree is on Sugarloaf, right next to Breakneck.
At the junction near the other not-as-cool-spooky-old-tree, instead of turning left to descend on the Yellow (Wilkinson Memorial) Trail, you’d turn right to ascend Sugarloaf.
That old tree is a local landmark – anyone who chooses to visit, please treat it with respect!
(I know you would do this, Ceem, but I did accidentally share a photo of two people sitting in the tree on this site’s Facebook page.
I thought they were branches when I glanced at the otherwise stunning picture on my phone.
When I looked at a bigger screen and realized what was going on in that shot, I deleted it from my Facebook timeline, which is probably why you can’t find it there anymore.
That tree would surely not survive being treated like that for long, and it would be a real loss if that thing came down.)
Hope that helps! 0 ↓ Ceem said: I know. If that tree doesn’t survive, people like me might not have a chance to see it anymore!
And thank you for letting me know where it is! I will visit it next week. Thanks again! 1 tami said: which of those was your favorite? 0 ↓ Dave said: Great site. My wife and I have done Anthony’s Nose, Storm King Mountain, and Bull Hill using this website this spring already.
Also have done the Major Welch trail in Bear Mountain.
How much more difficult is Breakneck than these?
I really want to do this and we’re in great physical shape but don’t want to underestimate.
Thanks! 0 ↓ Mike said: Dave, that’s awesome!
Glad the site has been useful for you.
Breakneck is comparable to the steepest parts of Storm King — I expect you guys won’t have any issues, but I gave this one a 10 out of 10 difficulty rating so people would take it seriously.
Happy adventuring! 0 ↓ Maloy said: 1 ↓ Mike said: Hi, Maloy!
I parked right next to the tunnel – I took a vacation day and did this hike on a weekday, so there were spots available there.
The overflow parking is just a little further north.
Not sure about the other trail you’re mentioning – I’ll have to look for it next time.
Sorry I can’t be more help on this one! 0 ↓ rick said: Last did this hike 25 years ago.
Wife and none of my out of shape BFFs are interested.
Too bad.
Spectacular views, challenging climb and an hour outside NYC.
It is a SCRAMBLE and at times will need all extremities to achieve solid hand/foothold.
You don’t need to do technical climbing for the harder (non-alternate) route but you should be very experienced or at least go with someone who is so you can be leveraged ever upward.
Light gloves are good idea.
Plenty of water (amazing number of folks going up with no fluid replacement).
The cardiovascular challenge will have you sweating at 40 degrees F within 15 minutes so bring lots of easily sheddable layers if you want to be dry on the level
and descending part of the hike.
And the initial descent on the uneven Red bypass trail in late fall covered by leaves can be particularly challenging.
A good collapsible pole would be valuable here.
And above all take your time.
Start early enough…you want to budget comfortably 3hrs for traditional loop white-red-yellow-9D loop unless you want to be the object of ridicule (or worse) by the Cold Spring Fire and Ambulance crew. 0 ↓ cold spring resident said: City hikers – please use common sense when taking a trip up here from Brooklyn to hike. This is an incredibly dangerous and difficult hike. Please bring proper boots, proper gear and a map/compass. We love the visitors, but tire of our FD and amulence corps volunteers having to go out on calls to find lost hikers every weekend. 0 ↓ Justin said: Hey Mike, So, I got in touch with Chase at Xcelerated Adventures for my tour. There was a group of 12 of us and he was an AWESOME guide for this hike. For people who are not seasoned hikers but want to do something challenging like this, I think its super beneficial to do it with a guide. Chase was amazing! I’d highly recommend his company for these tours. 0 ↓ Justin said: Amazing!! Thanks so much!! 0 ↓ Justin said: I want to do the hike with a few friends this weekend. Does anyone know of an individual or company that offers guided tours for Breakneck Ridge? 0 ↓ Mike said: The bottom of the page says that their guided tours of Breakneck are closed until April – seems like unfortunate timing.
Might be worth reaching out to them, anyway.
Hope that helps! 0 ↓ Jeff said: Mike, thanks so much for putting this website together.
It has been extremely informative when planning hikes in and around the Hudson Valley. I am looking at hiking Breakneck Ridge this weekend and we’ll be taking the train from Grand Central.
I was thinking about starting at the Breakneck Ridge train station and ending in Cold Spring to take the train back from there.
In looking at the map, we were thinking of taking the Notch trail after the ruins and then taking the Washburn trail down to Little Stony Point to get some well deserved food in Cold Spring.
Since we won’t have a car, we don’t need to do the loop, so thought about mixing it up.
Have you done this version?
If so, any idea of the distance and time on this trail?
Much appreciated, Mike. Jeff 0 ↓ Mike said: Hi Jeff!
I’ve never done that route before, but on the map, it looks doable, assuming you are in really good shape and up for climbing both Breakneck Ridge and Bull Hill.
From the ruins to the Bull Hill parking lot (taking Notch Trail to Washburn Trail), it’s about 3 miles, going straight up and back down the mountain.
A tamer option would be to take the Red Trail (Brook Trail) from the ruins, then down the Blue Trail (Cornish Trail) back to the parking lot, which completely avoids climbing Bull Hill.
The good news is that you’ve got options — you can see how you’re feeling at the ruins and decide whether to tackle Bull Hill or not.
Sounds like a great day either way — hope you enjoy it!
(Update: My original comment misstated the elevation change and total distance — the Notch Trail doesn’t go over the summit of Bull Hill, but it comes pretty close.
The total distance from the ruins to the parking lot would be just over three miles (not four, as I’d originally said) going Brook (Red) Trail -> Notch (Yellow) -> Washburn (White).
Sorry about that!) 0 ↓ Gabe said: Woot, finally made it out to the hike and it was great. A little nerve racking as we never rock scrambled before and we got a little frazzled at the end trying to follow the yellow train connected to Fire Tower lane (beware, a few trail markers are on downed trees and some sections near the small stream can get you lost). Will be making this trip again. On a side note, on the listing of trails, would it be possible to add a list of hikes that can be reached without a car? Will be looking forward to go on more runs. Thank you. Gabe 0 ↓ Mike said: 0 ↓ Gabe said: Gabe 0 ↓ Mary DeWitt said: My husband and I hiked this for the first time yesterday. It is challenging but worth it! The views are fantastic! 0 ↓ Korin G. said: Really hoping its nice tomorrow and I will be going on this trek!
So excited, thank you for all the good reference points!!! 0 ↓ Krista said: Tried this for the first time today. This was probably the hardest trail I’ve done to date, but
you really feel on top of the world once you finally…finally!!!…reach the top. Thank you for noting the nice loop trail. I was very happy to learn I would NOT have to navigate my way back down some of those really sheer rock faces. I would definitely do this again! 0 ↓ pwchao said: We finished this loop today (7/6/2014) and enjoyed it very much. The views and rocks are spectacular. We are 70+ years old and used alternative routes to reach the top. We will go back to hike this loop again soon. 0 ↓ Mike said: That’s fantastic!
Hope I’m still motoring up Breakneck when I’m 70+, too.
Glad to hear you all enjoyed it. 0 ↓ Mara said: I was trying to give you a thumbs up!
Not sure what happened.
Kudos to you!!!!!!! 0 ↓ aaron said: Is the rock climbing described straight up a rock face or over boulders/onto ledges? 0 ↓ leah said: Good news!!! I took him there yesterday and he LOVED it (as did I). I even got him to say he would rather be there than six flags 🙂 your guide was awesome… And yes he managed the whole loop!!!! Was an awesome family hike thanks for this awesome website 0 ↓ Mike said: You just made my day – thank YOU, Leah!
That’s awesome to hear! 0 ↓ leah said: I spent a year in Israel doing some crazy hikes, but always with a guide. I was thinking that it was time to discover my home country and your site seens like an awesome place to start! Breakneck sound amazing from all I’ve read online. I’m just a little apprehensive of the initial hour of rock scrambling that everyone discusses bec I plan On bringing my thirteen year old baby brother. (he is not a bad hiker… He’s done mohonk mountain and loved it) any advice? 0 ↓ Mike said: Hi, Leah!
If he’s done Mohonk, I bet he’ll be just fine at Breakneck.
I saw some very young kids (6 or 7 years old) on my last trek there, and they seemed to be eating it up.
I doubt they did the whole loop, but even the trip to the flagpole and back is rewarding.
Hope you have a great trip and enjoy exploring the area! 0 ↓ Daisy said: Are guides readily available at this site? 0 ↓ Mike said: 0 ↓ tarajean said: I’m a bit scared of heights, but fit and cautious.
Bull Hill wasn’t a problem for me, but walking a treeless outcropping while viewing the river below is going to be problematic!
Thoughts? 0 ↓ Mike said: Heights are kind of part of the package with Breakneck, but the trail doesn’t force you to walk out to any cliff edges if you’d prefer not to.
Hope you enjoy it if you decide to check it out! 0 ↓ Kiran Mahale said: One of my friends suggested the hiking place and I came across ur site/blog. After reading your site I was planning to do alone but both of my kids were crying while I was leaving. So I took both of them for hiking. While driving to the tunnel destination my thinking was if it is difficult as mentioned in couple of sites I would just visit near by view point. But Once I reached the place both girls were ready to roll. Yesterday I did hiking with my 2 girls(7 year, 5 year) and we did 3.5 mile loop(W+R+Y) in 3.5 hours. We started at 2:30 and my the time we reached 1200 ft it was 4:30 but girls were still energetic. The view is so beautiful up there. I could not believe my 5 year old kid did this. Couple of dogs were climbing with their owners and my 5 year old just followed the dogs up hill. Your site helped me to understand where to see red and yellow trails and other alt routes. 1 ↓ Elizabeth said: Hello!
I did the Labyrinth at Mohonk two years ago and loved it. There’s something so much more fun about rock scrambles vs. hiking.
But I missed the Lemon Squeeze due to time constraints and pure inability to follow the right path.
I’m looking at doing Breakneck, Mohonk, or something else in the area, and my main goal is fun rock scrambling without dying.
The two mile walk just to GET to the rock scramble at Mohonk has me a little wary of Mohonk – how would you compare the two if my main goal is to climb on some rocks? 0 ↓ Tracy said: I’ve done this hike many times.. The views are breath taking. I’ve always taken the yellow down. If you take the yellow down and cross the bridge over a small creek and make a left, not far up is an old dairy barn. After exploring it for a few minutes I turn around and follow the road down you come across a cistern. The last two times I’ve passed it, it was filled with huge frogs. Continue walking and you will come to the old Cornish Estate. We were lucky enough to come across some locals who knew the history of the place and had some photos of what the house looked like before the fire. It’s a cool place to explore. To get back out to 9D you follow the red trail. 0 ↓ Bo Bell said: Great writeup, thanks! Just a note for dog owners: I live in Cold Spring and do this trail with my dog often, but she’s a Border Collie and kinda crazy athletic. She has no problem with this trail, but other dogs may. If your dog is lightweight, agile, and all over everything in the outdoors, it will probably be ok; if you have doubts, best to leave them behind. 0 ↓ Susan Haller said: The information that you provided was perfect. I can’t tell you how much my husband and I enjoyed the scramble up the first mile (with your encouragement that the rest would be easier). The Hudson River Valley is such a lovely place. Thank you. 0 ↓ Sue Edelstein said: 0 ↓ justin said: Could you tell me a way to get from breakneck to indian brook? 0 ↓ Mike said: Hey Justin, I’m afraid I don’t know of an easy way to do it.
The trailheads are about three miles apart.
If you’re up for that stroll, I suppose it’s possible, but that’s a pretty long road trek.
If anyone knows of a good cab service in Cold Spring, please illuminate us! 0 ↓ Peter said: 0 ↓ peter said: 0 ↓ Inessa said: This looks amazing!
What special skills/equipment/preparation is needed to attempt this hike?
Can a couple who hasn’t really hiked (but occasionally trailruns) complete this? We are runners and are in reasonably good shape (running 5K at least 5 times a week).
Can we do this with no special prep? 0 ↓ RicheRich said: Just good boots, you take the white trail up, easier staying to the left, nice hike on white and you can always go to the right for a more difficult climb, venture off trail for some abandoned building,s
nice Hike , we go on weekdays because it can get busy on weekends, going next monday 0 ↓ Mike said: Sounds like you’re in much better shape than me!
You should be good to go.
As RicheRich said, just good footwear, some water, snacks and a healthy sense of caution should be all you need.
If you check it out, have fun!
And if you go on one of these beautiful weekend days, enjoy all the company! 0 ↓ Jenna said: I’ve done this hike on numerous occasions & absolutely love it! I came across your website today when searching for other hikes in the area. Thanks for much for putting this all together, its awesome! 0 ↓ Mike said: Thanks so much! 0 ↓ joe said: more than your average hike!
Piles of slippery leaves, dry grass, etc. careful esp. coming down.
Great vistas, bring a snack and water and chill.
9D north of tunnel near start, witnessed a dog severely stuck by a vehicle, just missed a kid.
10 min. later another crash which my daughter saw, I heard.
Very dangerous combination of cars parked along the road, traffic going too fast, people crossing the street.
Heads up! 0 ↓ Mike said: Yikes!
I hope the dog and everyone else will be okay.
Thanks for the reminder to be careful here! 0 ↓ RicheRich said: I first did this hike 15 years ago with my new Bride and puppy, more recently (past 4 years I’ve done this hike in the spring and fall, with at the time 5 year old and his 9 year old brother, last time my 11 year old daughter joined us, looking forward to going again march/April 2013, I really enjoyed your video and pictures 0 ↓ Mike said: That’s great that your kids were up to the challenge!
I hope mine will be when they’re a little older, too (they’re 10 months and 3 years right now, so they’ve got a little time yet).
Hope you have some great hikes this year, and thanks for the nice words! 0 ↓ Christopher Buck said: Hi there, Great article.
This may be a rhetorical question, but if I’m concerned about my dog, can I just take the yellow Wilkinson trail, to the red trail to the top? Thanks, Chris 0 ↓ Mike said: Chris, Thanks!
And yes, you can do that, then you could just take the White (Breakneck) Trail downhill until it gets too dicey for your pooch.
You’d still get some nice views from the top of the White Trail that way, but if you had to turn around and come back the way you came, you’d be missing out on the awesome views and clifftop perches that are farther down the White Trail (near the flagpole and immediately above it).
To me, helping a dog up a steep patch is easier than helping her down, so
I prefer to come up the White Trail.
That’s all a long way of saying — yes, your alternate plan would be perfectly pooch-safe, but you might miss out on a view or two.
Hope you and your dog enjoy the hike — should be a beautiful time of year to visit! Mike 0 ↓ Christopher Buck said: Thanks Mike,
How about taking the alternate ‘x’ trails on the White on the way up.
Does that make it anymore dog friendly? -Chris 0 ↓ Mike said: Chris, a bit more — it did save me one dog carry to try the other way at one of the Xs —
but there’s no way around hoisting the dog over certain sections.
My dog is forty pounds and it wasn’t a huge issue — but I can imagine that it could be for some dogs, especially if their owners can’t help give them a boost.
My friends’ black lab made it just fine, but that dog also needed to be hoisted in a couple of spots.
I would think most healthy dogs should probably not have too much of an issue, but it’ll definitely be a team effort in places. 0 ↓ Your email address will not be published. * * * * Recent Comments Andrey Breakneck Ridge Breakneck to Close for Repairs - http://highlandscurrent.com/2017/09/15/breakneck-close-repairs/ Sep 15, 15:28 A Surprise Lake II (via Greenwood Lake overlook) We got there before 10 am and the parking was fine.

Hike Checklist:
Whether you are going for a day hike or backpacking overnight, it is good practice to carry what we call The Hiking Essentials. These essentials will help you enjoy your outing more and will provide basic safety gear if needed. There may also be more essentials, depending on the season and your needs. The Essentials Hiking Shoes or Boots Sunscreen and insect repellent Check the weather forecast before you head out. Know the rules and regulations of the area. The Leave No Trace Seven Principles Plan Ahead and Prepare Know the regulations and special concerns for the area you'll visit. Prepare for extreme weather, hazards, and emergencies. Schedule your trip to avoid times of high use. Visit in small groups when possible. Consider splitting larger groups into smaller groups. Repackage food to minimize waste. Use a map and compass to eliminate the use of marking paint, rock cairns or flagging. Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces Durable surfaces include established trails and campsites, rock, gravel, dry grasses or snow. Protect riparian areas by camping at least 200 feet from lakes and streams. Good campsites are found, not made. Altering a site is not necessary. In popular areas: Concentrate use on existing trails and campsites. Walk single file in the middle of the trail, even when wet or muddy. Keep campsites small. Focus activity in areas where vegetation is absent. In pristine areas: Disperse use to prevent the creation of campsites and trails. Avoid places where impacts are just beginning. Dispose of Waste Properly Pack it in, pack it out. Inspect your campsite and rest areas for trash or spilled foods. Pack out all trash, leftover food and litter. Deposit solid human waste in catholes dug 6 to 8 inches deep, at least 200 feet from water, camp and trails. Cover and disguise the cathole when finished. Pack out toilet paper and hygiene products. To wash yourself or your dishes, carry water 200 feet away from streams or lakes and use small amounts of biodegradable soap. Scatter strained dishwater. Leave What You Find Preserve the past: examine, but do not touch cultural or historic structures and artifacts. Leave rocks, plants and other natural objects as you find them. Avoid introducing or transporting non-native species. Do not build structures, furniture, or dig trenches. Minimize Campfire Impacts Campfires can cause lasting impacts to the backcountry. Use a lightweight stove for cooking and enjoy a candle lantern for light. Where fires are permitted, use established fire rings, fire pans, or mound fires. Keep fires small. Only use sticks from the ground that can be broken by hand. Burn all wood and coals to ash, put out campfires completely, then scatter cool ashes. Respect Wildlife Observe wildlife from a distance. Do not follow or approach them. Never feed animals. Feeding wildlife damages their health, alters natural behaviors, and exposes them to predators and other dangers. Protect wildlife and your food by storing rations and trash securely. Control pets at all times, or leave them at home. Avoid wildlife during sensitive times: mating, nesting, raising young, or winter. Be Considerate of Other Visitors Respect other visitors and protect the quality of their experience. Be courteous. Yield to other users on the trail. Step to the downhill side of the trail when encountering pack stock. Take breaks and camp away from trails and other visitors. Let nature's sounds prevail. Avoid loud voices and noises. The Trail Conference is a 2015 Leave No Trace partner. Let's Go Directions to Trailhead :

Hiking Trail guides Map of trails around the park entrance Trails beyond the park entrance: Savage River, Eielson Visitor Center, Wonder Lake Trail details & a print-friendly map Tips for off-trail hiking Map of closed areas NPS Photo / Emily Mesner Trail Guides
Trails Around the Entrance of Denali Trails Not Near the Park Entrance The more strenuous Savage Alpine Trail runs more than four miles, and connects the Savage River area with Savage River Campground. Use the Savage River Shuttle to travel back to your starting point if you need to pick up a car, or use it to return to the park entrance if you have no vehicle; or, you can walk about two miles along the park road. The Tundra Loop is around a third of a mile through alpine country, very close to the visitor center. A spur trail leads an additional quarter of a mile, one-way, off the Tundra Loop. Trail Details An additional wrinkle is that not every trailhead is at a visitor center or road. In those cases, you might need to add a bit more time (e.g., the Meadow View Trail is only a third of a mile long, but to get to either trailhead you must hike along one of a couple different trails from the visitor center). Some of the longer trails are explained in greater detail on separate pages, linked below. A popular trail that descends to, and travels entirely around, a lake. 1 hour one-way 3.2 miles 250 feet A short, forested trail mainly used to access Horseshoe Lake from the visitor center. 45 minutes one-way 0.9 mile 75 feet Descend from the visitor center to Hines and Riley Creeks, and pass under the Alaska Railroad trestle. 1 hour one-way 1.6 miles 100 feet An increasingly steep hike out of the forest and into the alpine country. Potential views of Denali, if skies are clear. 2 hours one-way 2.7 miles 1,700 feet Travels uphill from the visitor center to the sled dog kennels and park headquarters. 1 hour one-way 1.8 miles 350 feet Travels right along the Denali Park Road, between the entrance and the visitor center. 45 minutes one-way 1.7 miles 150 feet A steep shortcut from Riley Creek Campground to the Canyon, the business district outside the park. 10 minutes one-way 0.3 mile 75 feet Paved path alongside Highway 3. 30 minutes one-way 1.0 mile 50 feet Occasionally steep trail through forest. Similar route to Roadside, but a bit longer and much quieter, as it's farther from the road. 1.5 hours one-way 2.4 miles 400 feet A very narrow trail overlooking a meadow, forming a short connection between Rock Creek and Roadside Trails. 15 minutes 0.3 mile none Denali's longest trail, with bridges over two creeks and great views of three lakes. 5 hours one-way 9.5 miles 1,000 feet A short trail through spruce forest. Good for a quick walk while waiting on a bus or train. 15 minutes one-way 0.2 mile none A short trail through spruce forest. Good for a quick walk while waiting on a bus or train. 20-minutes, total 0.2 mile none Located at Mountain Vista Rest Area, at Mile 13 of the Denali Park Road. Can be accessed by the free Savage River Shuttle and private vehicle, with ample parking available 30-minutes, total 0.6 mile total
Connects Savage River, campground and Mountain Vista day use areas. Parking available at either end. Use free Savage River Shuttle to return to your vehicle. Considered strenuous Three hours, one way 4 miles, one way 1,500 feet Located at the Savage River at Mile 15. Very limited parking available. Can be accessed by free Savage River Shuttle 90 minutes, total 2 miles, total
From the Eielson Visitor Center, at Mile 66 of the Denali Park Road, this short loop explores alpine tundra. 15 minutes total 0.3 mile, total negligible From the Eielson Visitor Center, this switchback trail climbs to a ridge for high, scenic views of Denali and a vast expanse of tundra beyond. One hour, one way 0.8 mile, one way 1,000 feet From a road junction approaching Wonder Lake Campground, this trail passes through wet meadows and enters spruce forest, and ends at the McKinley River 90 minutes, one way 2.4 miles, one way negligible Accessibility The details below are meant to help you decide whether or not to travel a particular trail if you are using a wheelchair or similar assistive device. Trails not listed here are not barred to wheelchairs, but may have particularly significant natural obstacles.
Where to Start? Hiking in the Wilderness Terrain Equipment & Travel Tips Carry adequate food and water. There are no restaurants or amenities west of mile 3 on the Park Road.
Plan for bad weather. Rain is likely (and snow is possible) in summer. A hat, gloves, rain jacket and rain pants may be necessary. Other gear, such as trekking poles, calf-high gaiters and ankle-high boots will make your hike more comfortable. Be prepared to self-rescue and carry a first aid kit. Travel immediately to the Park Road and flag down a ranger or bus driver if you need assistance.

hiking Well maintained trails, plenty of birds and chipmunks, some deer, frogs, and turtles. A shorter walk, but it's well worth it. You wouldn't even know you're five minutes from the GWB. Overall a nice escape with a nature center and owls. Be prepared for school trips in the spring and fall. Zulia Hernández

I have bookmarked a ton of places since moving here that I want to hike at or experience and this one was close to where I live.
Parking was simple. No charge to get in. Not a ton of people.
This park was really nice. They have plaques with information on each area and what type of habitat it is and what animals you can find in each section. We hiked the trails just after it had rained and I brought all 3 of my kids (14,5 and 2!) and it did get muddy but they have wooden pieces across most of the muddy areas so it wasn't too bad.
We saw a baby deer!! We saw bullfrogs, chipmunks and tons of birds. My kids had a blast and this was fairly easy for them to hike without problems. I want to come back with just my older son and stay longer. Def worth checking out!
Being outside is always better than inside.
Very nice getaway and you can easily go through all the trails in one day. I was going it alone today so this place was a great choice because it's not so secluded and there were enough people on the trails to make me feel comfortable.
The hike was beautiful. It is one long trail that connects water and trees so you get a little bit of both scenery. The park is clean and dog friendly. There are benches and people bbqing but there is a lot of room to move around so it's never overly crowded.
Whenever I get a chance, I am either on the hunt for a new restaurant, going to the theatre, or hiking. Flat Rock Brook is a far cry from some of the hikes that I've conquered, but it is a beautiful escape minutes from Fort Lee, NJ offering nature lovers a chance to relax and detox from the everyday hustle and bustle. The park offers seven (7) clearly marked trails approximately 4 miles in total with some hills and steps but mostly flat an slight inclines. Follow the trails to
Macfadden's Wetlands and the Mystery Bridge to get beautiful views of snapping turtles, painted turtles, bullfrogs, fish, birds, and deer. Oh, did I mention that you'll find the largest population of chipmunks ever! It's a great place for family fun with a wonderful playground, nature center, and picnic areas. Enjoy!
Nice little park hidden in the Englewood/Englewood Cliffs/Fort Lee area. Given the relatively small size of the park, you will find yourself walking the same route most visits. They have slowly been improving the trail quality and removing fallen trees/branches over the years.
akiva r.
we went on a bunch of the trails and they were all great. they were all well taken care of and even though we went right after heavy rain they weren't very muddy. got to see a bunch of deer, chipmunks, and interesting birds. the nature center building was also interesting with some turtles and other items of interest. we went with children of various ages and there was something for everyone here.
After reading Last Child in the Woods by Richard Louv I've been on more of a nature kick than normal. Growing up I basically lived outside. Now raising a little girl in NYC it seems this would be a challenge. It's actually not, we spend most of our days outside, but finding babbling brooks and catching minnows is something we've been missing...until yesterday.
Flat Rock Brook Nature Center, located in Englewood, NJ, is just a short drive over the George Washington Bridge. It's a well maintained 150-acre forest preserve with 3.6 miles of trails, a babbling brook filled with minnows and turtles and woods full of birds and chipmunks. My boyfriend and I made this adventure with our 4 year old daughter during a heat wave. It ended up being the perfect reprieve from the heat and allowed us to be outdoors rather than chilling in the air conditioning with the TV, like we are today :).
It's easy to navigate to the main nature center where you can pick up trail maps, use their bathrooms and learn more about the preserve. This nature center feels like it's situated within a suburb, but this area is actually part of the western slope of the Palisades. We ended up driving to a side parking area on Jones Road which allowed us to park just steps from the brook and playground, where we spent most of our time. This area also has bathrooms and trail maps where you can choose from 3.6 miles of different self-guided trails. We enjoyed the crystal clear stream, saw turtles, various bird, wildflowers and tons of chipmunks. We also saw an egret and some other kind of bird catching fish from the brook, right in front of us! We spent most of our time trying to catch minnows and playing in the stream but we also enjoyed the playground which was fun and had an interesting ropes area. We spent only a short time exploring the trails, which I'd like to go back and hike further.
When a friend told me about Flat Rock I was excited to check it out. It exceeded my expectations and I can't wait to return. Next time I want to explore some of the seven hiking paths which are mostly flat and easy to navigate. This area is perfect for families. It may not be challenging enough for the avid hiker but there is ample nature and wildlife to satisfy most anyone.
Tips:
There are two parking areas, the main Nature Center, or a smaller one off Jones Road. The Jones Road one takes you straight to the playground.
If you want to play in the brook and catch minnows bring a net, bathing suit, water shoes and a towel.
No dogs allowed.
There are picnic tables but no grills allowed.
No biking on the trails.
The water is crystal clear and the park is well maintained.
There are many educational and camp opportunities for all ages, check out their site if interested in this.
This drive is about 5 minutes of the GWB.
Bring insect repellent.

I love this place so much! I come here a lot as I am lucky enough to leave just a few minutes away. The trails are nice, the park is peaceful. I love the stream and pond. They sometimes have maps there but you don't really need them. Park is clean and naturally beautiful. The nature center building is cute and informative. Also in the garden section they have a recycle area and injured birds and owls that have been saved. Josephine the big owl is beautiful. Highly recommend to go here. Its a nice getaway, safe, clean, and peaceful. Get to see lots of beautiful deer! Families of deers at times. Gets a bit packed on weekends but not overly crowded.
I have never in my life so quickly fallen in love with a place as I have with Flat Rock Brook. I found this place on a whim while taking my customary Sunday morning drive after work. (I work the graveyard shift.) Having always seen it on my GPS, I made it a mission to find it and go on a quick hike.
I found it at the dead end of Van Nostrand Ave in Englewood; a gravel pit parking area complete with a small gazebo picnic area next to the pond and small boardwalk with it's own aviary and garden and an actual "Nature Center," which was closed, that may be used as a classroom for field trip students or perhaps as an educational museum-style building. I thought that this area was beautiful in itself so I couldn't wait to see the trails.
Maps were available at the beginning of the trails and, to prevent waste, they ask that one map be taken per group. The map consisted of the trails and different areas available throughout the park as well as park rules but I barely gave it a glance as I was off onto the Red Loop trail as quick as my feet could take me. It's their longest trail, (approx. 1mi.) but it's the one trail that intersects with all the other ones. Rugged terrain on most parts and narrow on others, my "quick hike" instantly upgraded to a light workout which put a BIG smile on my face! It's truly wonderful to find an actual hiking trail that can provide a bit of a challenge.
Moreover, the park, for lack of a better title, is filled with a variety of animals here and there. I've never seen so many chipmunks! Either that or the same one was following me around. Perhaps my most astounding find though was the deer sighting; two does, on the very trail right in front of me, just looked up at me as if they were saying hello to their neighbor and continued meandering into the flora and fauna nibbling here and there on a few leaves off of a low hanging branch. I was in pure awe! It's everything one could ask for out of a nature experience.
Perhaps the only downside is that they don't allow dogs. I know many a dog lover, myself included, that love walking trails with their doggy companions. However, after seeing how much animal activity there is in this park, I'm starting to see the reason behind the rule. Even if I didn't, it wouldn't be enough for me to give this place anything less than 5 stars. I cannot wait to go back!
This place is a Beautiful blip of nature in the middle of suburbia! I have driven past the picnic area section off Jones Road for years and I was always curious what the trails were like/how far back they actually went.
I decided my run needed a change of scenery one day so I went exploring the Flat Rock Brook Nature Center. The first thing a passerby notices are the huge signs forbidding dogs: this is actually brilliant! There aren't maps of the trails readily available at the picnic area entrance of the park, so i just let my legs do the work and i followed any trail maker on a whim. Thankfully, i wasn't worried or distracted about the possibility of stepping in anything undesirable!
The first orange trail was a tiny loop, which was a great warm up, but i found myself back where i started pretty quickly. Then i looked at one of the stationary maps (they are dirty and weathered and very difficult to read) and saw that the red and white trails appeared to go all the way up, so i decided to keep up the exploration. I am glad i did!
The trails are well maintained but can be narrow at times. I ran into several groups of school children, as I was there during a sporadic
"sick" day in the spring. I eventually came to the actual Nature Center, nestled towards the top of the park. There was a building there with restrooms and what I would presume to be an educational indoor
space and administrative offices. It was a nice place to take a bathroom break and stretch in the sun.
Overall, this is a great spot for a morning walk or
family hike or a first date. I did not see any other runners, and i know sometimes runners can be annoying for normal-paced people.
Nice place to hike, but not too much to take in. There were some wildlife like turtles there which was a plus. I think there are a few trails about 1 mile each. It was very clean and trails were maintained well.
This is a great place to take a hike and enjoy nature.
I love these wonderful trails. They're great for a small hike on a Saturday or Sunday.
This is an awesome place for an enthused hiker. There are several beautiful paths that can be followed. The entrance has a nice pond. If you find an area with a actual large flat rock over looking a lake, that is my favorite place to sit and hang out there. I love it here and need to go back once it gets nice out.
Great for kids! It could be a little bigger but the environment is diverse and pretty. Different sized trails and various lakes and streams. I in fact swam their in a deeper part of the stream when I was a child hahahha. I recommend this place.

If you find an area with a actual large flat rock over looking a lake, that is my favorite place to sit and hang out there. I love it here and need to go back once it gets nice out.

Great for kids! It could be a little bigger but the environment is diverse and pretty. Different sized trails and various lakes and streams. I in fact swam their in a deeper part of the stream when I was a child hahahha. I recommend this place.

Hike the Hudson Valley Hike the Hudson Valley Main menu Home The Hikes Store FAQ Leave No Trace Giant Ledge and Panther Mountain On our first visit here many years ago, my wife Kara and I visited Giant Ledge on a Saturday evening.  It was like Woodstock up there.  Beatles songs were playing on someone’s boombox.  Tents were pitched all over the place.  Laughter and loud talking echoed through the woods.  Awesome, this place is.  A well-kept secret, it is not. One step out onto that first ledge, though, and it’s easy to see why this place draws crowds. This hike is called Giant Ledge, but there are actually five distinct ledges where you can walk out and have the whole world (or at least a really large, Catskilly slice of the world) open up before you. It’ll be a 3.2-mile roundtrip if you just visit the first ledge and then return to your car.  If you go all the way to the fifth ledge, it’ll be a 4.0-mile roundtrip.  The view from each ledge is awesome, but they’re pretty similar.  Good to know that you have other options, though, in case you’d like a ledge to yourself and some of them are occupied, as they likely will be.  Just keep heading down the trail and there’ll be another ledge in a few minutes. One more item of interest – there are two large campsites right near the ledges, clearly marked and tucked back into the woods.  I’ll point them out in the trail guide below, in case you’d like to join the carnival up there one night. If you do climb Panther, though, you’ll be rewarded with some pretty awesome views – similar to Giant Ledge, but with a little more of that “I’m on top of the world” vibe. I know – I just told you not to climb Panther, then I told you how nice the view is up there.  Still, really, the view on Giant Ledge is pretty much equally awesome, and the hike to that point has some steep sections.  If I was bringing friends on this hike who weren’t super-crazy hiking goons, I wouldn’t even consider dragging them up Panther, too. However big a hike you decide to tackle at Giant Ledge, just be sure that you do come check it out.  Besides taking in all the awesome views, maybe you’ll make some new friends up there.  Then you can ask them to turn down their boomboxes. Trail guide: 1.  From the parking area on County Road 47 (see “Directions to the trailhead” below), turn to face uphill.  The trail starts just to the right of the guardrail directly uphill from the parking lot.  Carefully cross the road, go around the guardrail, and hop across the little footbridge to begin your adventure. 2.  Notice the sign telling you that you only have 1.5 miles left until Giant Ledge?  Woo hoo!  You’re already almost there!  Kind of.  Sign in at the register to make sure this trail gets credit for your visit.  You’ll be following those yellow blazes for the next .8 miles or so. 3.  In just a moment, cross a wooden footbridge that goes over a picturesque stream. 4.  Has anyone ever told you that this hike is easy?  They lied.  It is Catskill Easy, but not regular-world easy.  Over the next .7 miles, you’ll climb 725 feet over often-rocky terrain.  Next stop: junction with the blue-blazed Giant Ledge-Panther Mountain-Fox Hollow Trail.  It took me twenty minutes from the footbridge.  See you there! 5.  Did I mention this section is not easy?  Just wanted to make sure we’re clear on that point. 7.  Over the next .75 miles, you’ll climb another 410 feet on the Blue Trail.  Enjoy!  You may also find some wet sections here, where you’ll have to hop around the puddles.  Good thing you paid the extra twenty bucks for the Gore-tex shoes, right?  Right? About 15 minutes after the trail junction, you may notice a side trail to a spring splitting off to your left.  Just ignore it and keep heading straight.  Unless, you know, you need water and you brought a purifier.  In that case, you’d probably want to check out the spring. 9.  Just past that campsite marker, keep an eye out on your right for the first ledge.  Hell-ooo!  What a view.  If you can find a spot here to relax and soak in the view, you might very well want to make this your final destination. Careful at the edge.  One step too far, and this really will be your final destination.  Like, ever. 10.  After you’ve had time to enjoy the view, if you decide you’d like to head back now, by all means, do it.  You’ve seen the view at Giant Ledge – it’s really only very slightly different from the next four ledges.  They all look out in the same direction.  From this first ledge, it’s .8 miles down the Blue Trail to the fifth ledge, with the others dotting the way in-between, if you want to add them all to your retinal collection. If you head back now, hope you enjoyed the trip!  Retrace your steps back to your car – the only junction you have to worry about is the right turn onto the Yellow Trail about halfway down.  Be sure to eat some pizza tonight – you’ve earned it. If you continue reading from here, I’ll assume you’re tackling Panther Mountain, too.  If you’re doing that, see you at the next step, crazy person! 11.  On to Panther Mountain!  Did we finally ditch the Giant Ledge people?  Man, were they slowing us down, or what?  (Just kidding, Giant Ledge people.  I’m just trying to make the Panther people feel cool, since they’re about to burn at least 1,000 calories to see basically the same view they’re already looking at.  Just kidding, Panther people!  You’re going to be so glad you did this.) 12.  To climb Panther, keep heading straight along the Blue Trail, passing all five ledges at Giant Ledge, as well as the turnoff to the second DEC campsite.  Immediately after you pass the final ledge, the Blue Trail drops 200 feet in the saddle between Giant Ledge and the Panther ascent.  I hate losing altitude just to have to gain it again, too, but until someone installs a zipline here, this is what we’ve got. 13.  From the bottom of the saddle to the summit of Panther, you’ll ascend 730 feet over 1 mile, following the blue blazes the whole way. About halfway into that climb, you’ll notice the forest change.  For the first time in my life, I marked a spot on my hiking GPS with the label “Smell.”  Just as the trail reaches about 3,400 ft in altitude, you can smell the difference as you enter the alpine forest at the top of Panther.  Everything just feels different – cooler, darker, more remote.  That’s worth the price of admission right there, even without the very nice views you’re approaching. 14.  About 15 minutes after entering the alpine forest, you’ll see a short little unmarked side trail to your right, heading toward some big rocks. Carefully clamber on top of these rocks for your first Panther views.  Not bad, right? 15.  From that rock, it’s a flat .3 miles to the summit of Panther.  You’ll pass some smaller views on the way there – don’t be fooled into turning around yet. You’ll know you’re at the right spot when you reach a nice flat rock, right beside the trail, where you can sit and take in the wide-open view before you.  There’s not a ton of room right here, so hopefully you left most of the crowds back at Giant Ledge. It took me less than ten minutes to get here from the rock that we clambered up for our first Panther view. Here’s my best attempt at a panoramic stitch of the view: 16.  Retrace your steps back to your car.  Take the Blue Trail back down Panther, back up the little saddle (dude, more uphill?) to Giant Ledge, then turn right on the Yellow Trail for the last .75 miles back to your car. For the rest of the day, ask everyone you meet, “What size ledge did you climb today?”  Then tell them how big yours was. Directions to the trailhead:  From the New York Thruway (I-87) headed north from Poughkeepsie/New Paltz, take exit 19 for the Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge, then head west (away from the bridge) on Route 28.  Get comfortable – you’ll stay on Rt. 28 for another 30 miles.  At Big Indian, turn left onto County Road 47 (Oliverea Road – sometimes also marked as Fire House Road).  If you see the Peekamoose Restaurant and Tap Room on the left, that’s bad news – you just missed the turn. After turning onto County Road 47, in 7.4 miles, you’ll come to a hairpin turn to the right, heading up a large hill.  Parking for Giant Ledge is on the huge shoulder on the right side of the road, just before that hairpin turn.  A wooden sign on the shoulder marks the parking lot. Pull off onto the shoulder and get ready to begin your adventure!  You know you’re at a classy hike when there’s a porto-potty in the parking lot.  Feel free to hit that now, too.

Giant Ledge and Panther Mountain Katie said: What an incredible hike! My friends and I went around 10am on a Tuesday so the trail was nice and quiet, and we had the ledges all to ourselves. One thing I cannot stress enough: bring some form of bug repellent. Seems obvious enough, but we spent our time up top hopping from ledge to ledge to avoid being swarmed. Not sure if we just manged to hit a particularly bad day (we did go just after a few days of rain) but we definitely could have planned for that a bit better! Also, nearly stepped on a little snake on the way down- the lil guy went on his way with no bother but just be sure to keep an eye on where you’re walking! All in all, this hike more than deserves those 5 cameras. 0 ↓ Diane said: Thanks so much for the sharing! The article and comments are awesome and super helpful.
We plan to have a day hike there this weekend. But the description of
hiking the Parther Mountain scared me a little bit:) Since my husband and I are definitely not “super-crazy hiking goons”, I am a little hesitate about whether should we do the Parther part. How would you rank the difficulty if comparing the part of Parther trail to “Cascade and Porter” trail and “Esther and Whiteface” trail in ADK (we finished in a August’s weekend)? If the Parther part is even difficult than that two, we will definitely reconsider about hiking it this time. Thanks so much! 0 ↓ Sienna Emery said: So I plan on hiking this mountain in a couple of days, but was wondering does the easier trail still have the same views that these pictures are showing on this page? 0 ↓ Mike said: Hi Sienna!
If you don’t climb Panther Mountain, you’ll still see everything up to and including Step 10 above.
Enjoy the hike! 0 ↓ Erika said: Thank you so much for this write up. I just did this hike with my friend yesterday (We are Panther People! lol) and agree we found that final scramble up Panther more than a little challenging (and also the climb back up to the ledges on the way down) but that final view from the top of the world really did make it worth it. My favorite views that day were from the top of the large rock near the Panther summit and that final small ledge. It seems someone has taken the Panther Mountain summit marker so we were unsure we actually hit it until we came down and checked our maps and trail guides. Thanks for the awesome write up and confirmation that Panther people are actually the coolest. We thought so, but you helped us be sure! 2 ↓ Jeff Kent said: We camped in the area last summer, but didn’t manage to get any hiking in. This year we did Overlook Mt. and this here great big ledge sucker. Although we went on a Tuesday, the parking lot was already full. We had to park below it in the grass. Let me first say that we did this as a family with my wife (not a hiker), my 16 year old son (plenty capable though not 100% into it), my 12 year old son who was not at all interested and has ankle and weight issues…he bailed just before the yellow/blue split…my older son and I went the distance. Also my 8 year old daughter who played along, but was more than happy to bail out with Mom and her brother. Though the yellow section is less than a mile, it’s pretty dang rocky and has several steep sections. It seemed long to me because we kept stopping. The first .5 mile of the blue trail is dead flat, but towards the end there are a couple nasty steep sections with much larger rocks. I’d rate it higher than a 5 (especially if you have non hiker types with you), maybe if I had gone solo I’d feel different. I plan to come back by myself in the fall and do Panther plus. One additional note: a bridge on 28 a few miles before you get to 47 is under construction. Follow the detour and you end up ON 47…so no need to look fr the turn, you’re already there. 0 ↓ Norm said: Hey there!
Great trail description! Does anyone here know if there is an easy-to-find campsite at the beginning of this trail?
A few friends and I are planning to get up to this area in the evening, camp overnight, and then hit the trail first thing in the morning.
Would be great if we didn’t have to do too much routefinding/hiking in the dark. Any thoughts appreciated! Norm 0 ↓ Mike said: Hope that helps – enjoy it out there! 0 ↓ norm said: Thanks for the insight dave! I think we’re planning to keep going all the way to foxhollow then come back.
Do you know if the blue blazes remain easy to follow on the North side of Panther Mountain? Thanks again! Norm 0 ↓ Tim said: planning on taking a hike next week possibly nov 23.
how are the foliage this time of year? 0 ↓ Dave said: Hey — I went a few weeks ago, and most of the leaves are down at this point. However– the views are still amazing. 0 ↓ Mike said: 0 ↓ Jay said: Okay so let meh ask you this: Do you think that Giant Ledge/Panther and Wittenberg should be separated by 1 point, difficulty wise?
Thanks for the compliment 1 do like to liven things up whenever possible.
Have a good day. I enjoy your site. 0 ↓ Mike said: Hi Jay — I clocked Wittenberg as .3 miles longer than Panther, with 531 ft. more ascent.
I gave Wittenberg a 10/10 for difficulty, and Panther a 9/10.
I could see the argument for knocking Panther down to an 8 (since we’d have to move to the Spinal Tap scale to make Wittenberg more difficult), but it really just felt more like a 9 to me.
Maybe it was climbing the saddle on the way back that did it.
Which is all a long way of answering: Yes, one point seems about right to me, but I respect that others will have differing opinions. 0 ↓ Jay said: The hike up to Panther is fairly easy, the hardest part of the hike is to Giants Ledge. For anyone who wants to know the truth. 0 ↓ Mike said: Thanks for livening up the comments section, Jay! 0 ↓ Dave said: Just did this hike today and I’m really confused as to what mountain Jay hiked below. The portion of the hike from The Giant Ledges up to Panther was definitely a tough climb and I felt like it had steeper areas than the way up to the ledges. The hike to the Ledges and back probably would have been too short for the amount of time it took to get out to this spot, but luckily since it was late in the fall and a little cold, we had the place pretty much to our selves until we started heading back from Panther Mt.
The trail is super easy to follow, but challenging. The saddle between the Ledges and Panther was fairly deep and you definitely paid for it on the way back.
The views were outstanding, even though it was overcast, the mountains in the background gave off a blue tint, and were just stunning.
I definitely agree that heading all the way up to Panther is worth it, but it also 100% makes this hike a 9 out of 10 difficulty. 0 ↓ Mike said: Thanks so much, Dave!
I meant to respond to Jay’s comment when he left it
— I re-read the trail guide at that time, and still felt that it accurately depicted the hike (as I remembered it), and decided not to make any changes.
Your comment seals the deal for me. So glad you had a great day out there!
Hope you enjoyed a well-earned, larger-than-usual dinner tonight. 0 ↓ Nick said: 0 ↓ Jay said: I’m certain your write up is incorrect concerning which sections are difficult. The most difficult part of this hike is getting to Giant Ledge (with the rocky sections you describe being the accurate part).
But, Panther is a relatively easier hike from Giant Ledge, it’s just that you’re already tired out from the steep rock ascents associated with your initial trip up to Giant Ledge. It’s not a long distance to Giant Ledge but there are steep sections which make it more on the difficult side of moderate. Panther Mountain has some steep sections as well, but it’s not as bad as the trip to Giant Ledge.
Not sure why Panther would be 9/10?
Panther should be 5/10 where as Giant Ledge should be 7/10 for the steep rocky sections that might hinder some older or less fit folks. 0 ↓ Jay said: Meaning once you get to Giant Ledge, Panther is a 5/10 FROM Giant Ledge.
But your review makes it appear that Panther has steeper, rockier traverses than does Giant Ledge, not true. The initial trip up to Giant Ledge is more steep and rocky. 0 ↓ Mike said: Hi Jay, Dave’s comment above just brought me back to your comment — I’d meant to respond when you left it, apologies for not getting back here until now.
After reading this guide over again, it’s my opinion that it accurately depicts this hike to the best of my abilities (you know, given what they are).
I can see your point about the steep, rocky sections in the beginning of the hike — but to me, doing a 3.2-mile hike with some steep sections warrants a 5/10, while tacking on an additional 3.7 miles and 1,000+ vertical feet appropriately nudges that difficulty to a 9/10.
Thanks for taking the time to post your thoughts here – I want to encourage people to poke and prod at these guides to help them be as useful and accurate as possible.
Happy adventuring! Mike 0 ↓ Jay said: Actually reviewing my post, Panther is more like 3/10 from Giants, and Giants Ledge 4/10 from the lot, making the entire hike more like 7/10. But 9/10, really?
Wittenberg would be more like a 9/10. 0 ↓ Mike said: 0 ↓ Jeff Kent said: If you happen to be a geology geek, this may be of interest to you… http://hudsonvalleygeologist.blogspot.com/2013/05/panther-mountain-impact-structure.html 0 ↓ jhat said: I noticed you had a dog (labbie?)
with you on this hike.
How was it for him/her?
I’m looking for a good hike with my labbie in the Catskills, but from my experience many of the peaks have rock scrambles that present a challenge for dogs.
I haven’t done giant ledge or panther before so any input on your dog’s experience would be helpful.
Thanks! 0 ↓ Dusty said: A friend and I did this most awesome trail a few weeks ago. I love your humourous take on it. Had me chuckling while reading as I retraced every single rock…and every little scramble up and down that blasted path. Absolutely incredible views from Giant and Panther. Proud to say…I’m a Panther person! We had a great time, saw a LOT of butterflies enjoying the views and had lunch on the rocks at Panther’s summit before heading down. I love your idea of a zipline over the col!!! Yes, that would be a great alternative. I too hate losing altitude just to climb back up…Some of those rock scrambles were quite fun as well. But oh my if that view wasn’t worth every single step. No matter what peaks I have climbed, and what will be coming in the future, this is definitely one of the best hikes I have done, including my section hikes of the NY Appalachian Trail. The stop at the spring is worth it too for some ice cold spring water on a hot day. It was absolutely freezing, and after some filtering with my Sawyer Mini to lose the potential cryptosporidium and giardia beasts….the BEST water I’ve had yet out in the woods.
Catskillblogger, I hope you’re all healed up after your tumble! Definitely give this one another go when you feel ready to…You won’t regret it and as Mike said…a guaranteed better time the second go around 😉 Hike safe! 0 ↓ catskillblogger said: I attempted this hike this past weekend. I wish I had read this first…lol. I’m not an experienced hiker, and only made it about halfway before I slipped and bashed my face into a rock and had to turn around and go back. My only few of the day was the Margaretville ER. 0 ↓ Mike said: Oh no!
So sorry that happened!
Must have been a very scary experience.
On the plus side, if you ever come back here, you’re pretty much guaranteed to have a better experience than you did the first time.
Hope you’re feeling better and all is well! 0 ↓ Dawn said: 0 ↓ Mike said: Dawn, your comment cracked me up (cracked me up eight months ago, too, when I should have replied).

Hiking in Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park NPS Photo The true character of the park is best discovered on foot. With over 150 miles of trails in the park, exploration by walking and hiking can be a fascinating and enjoyable experience. Park trails range in difficulty from easy walks like Kīpukapuaulu (Bird Park) or Nāhuku (Thurston Lava Tube) to longer hikes such as Kīlauea Iki or Mauna Iki. Other trails provide access through wilderness areas and are suitable only for those who are in top physical condition and properly outfitted with winter gear. Most trails are well maintained and easy to follow. Wilderness trails are roughly marked by ahu (cairns - piles of rock). Devastation and Waldron Ledge trails are paved and accessible to wheelchairs and strollers. Rangers on duty in the Kīlauea Visitor Center (open from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. daily), will assist hikers with trail information and maps. Last updated: August 30, 2017 Contact the Park

Hiking Trails
Aspen—and the entire Roaring Fork Valley—is the epitome of a hiker’s paradise with a system of trails for all abilities. Whether it’s the multi-night trek across the Four Pass Loop for experts or a paved path for beginners, the scenery through fields of wildflowers, across rushing streams, or deep into a dense forest will stay with you forever. IN & AROUND ASPEN Elevation: 7,700 ft. - 7,900 ft. This is both a hiking and biking trail. The trail starts behind the Post Office on Puppy Smith Road. The first two miles of the trail are paved and then becomes a dirt trail after crossing Cemetery Road. Elevation: 8,900 ft. - 10,400 ft. The trail begins just east of the apartments on Lone Pine Road or directly off of the Rio Grande Trail extension which was completed in 2013.  This is a gradual uphill climb along the Hunter Creek towards Hunter Valley.  To access the upper trail, drive north on Mill Street, veer left onto Red Mountain Road and follow for 1.1 miles to Hunter Creek Road.  Turn right onto Hunter Road and follow the signs to the parking lot.  Upper portions of the trail pass through alpine meadows scattered with several abandoned homestead cabins.  Miles one way: 6.5. Elevation: 8,000 ft. - 10,000 ft. The first part of the trail contains a series of switchbacks through sagebrush and scrub oak. About 1 mile along the trail, you will cross a driveway and then continue on to Red Mountain. The trail finally joins with the Hunter Creek Trail in the Hunter Creek Valley. As there are many spurs that can lead to one getting lost, a topographical map is recommended. Miles one way: 6.3. EAST OF ASPEN OFF OF HWY 82 One way, the trip is about 0.6 miles. This is a popular area for picnicking and exploring.  There is a waterfall, some interesting rock formations, an ice cave, and numerous short trails.  This is a great area for families. The old town of Ruby is an abandoned mining camp.  Drive east on Hwy 82 for 11 miles to the Lincoln Creek Road turnoff.  Follow the dirt road 6 miles to Grizzly Reservoir.  At this point the road becomes a four-wheel drive road.  You can begin your hike here.  The road continues 5 miles to the ghost town of Ruby.  The hike begins at about 10,400 feet in elevation. This trail is located approximately 13 1/2 miles east of Aspen on Hwy 82 on your right.  This is designed to give the blind hiker a feel for the outdoors.  Twenty-two messages are provided along the trail in both Braille and in print.  Nylon cord guides are provided for the blind.  The hike is 3.6 miles (one way) in length with an elevation gain of 2,000 feet.  A moderate hike until the end where you have 1/4 of a mile of switchbacks. Elevation: 10,300 ft. - 12,300 ft. The trail is 3.9 miles one way.  Tabor Lake is accessible from this trail about 1/2 mile to the west.  The trail follows an old jeep road and will end with Anderson Lake 1/3 of a mile to the left and Petroleum Lake  3/4 of a mile to the right.  The total hiking distance to Petroleum Lake is 1.8 miles one way.  Miles one way: 8.9.  Elevation: 10,500 ft. - 12,800 ft.  Miles one way: 8.8.  Elevation: 9,900 ft. - 11,900 ft. The trail connects with the Hunter Creek Trail that eventually will take you back to Aspen (20 miles).  A topographical map is mandatory!  Elevation: 10,000 ft. - 12,300 ft. The length is 4.2 miles one way.  A topographical map is mandatory - it is easy to get lost. IN & AROUND WOODY CREEK Miles one way: 9.7.  Elevation: 8,600 ft. - 11,600 ft.  Elevation: 8,500 ft. - 12,500 ft.

IN THE CASTLE CREEK VALLEY Miles one way: 8.5.  Elevation: 8,500 ft. - 12,500 ft.  The natural Hot Springs is at the end of a gently rising 8.8 miles.  Camping around the Hot Springs is limited.  If continuing up Triangle Pass, you can connect with the East Maroon and Copper Passes, or continue approximately 10 miles further to Gothic at Crested Butte. This was once a popular old wagon road to Crested Butte.  This trail, which is also a 4-wheel drive road, begins off Castle Creek Road about 1 3/4 miles beyond the ghost town of Ashcroft.  The road starts to the right, continue about 3 1/4 miles until a fork is reached.  Veering to the left will take you to the top of Pearl Pass (4 1/2 miles).  The right fork leads to Montezuma Basin.  Miles one way: 3.2.  Elevation: 9,400 ft. - 11,400 ft.  The trail rises steeply and then follows a series of switchbacks for the first 1 1/2 miles.  Then the trail levels off with gentle rises until you reach the lake at 3.2 miles.  Miles one way: 3.5.  Elevation: 9,500 ft. - 11,866 ft.  The trail climbs steadily and then reaches a series of switchbacks followed by a marked fork.  Take the left fork to Cathedral Lake for a total hike of 3.2 miles.  Cathedral Lake is very scenic with fair fishing.  If hiking to Electric Pass, it is advisable to start early and descend by Noon, as lightning storms are likely to occur in the afternoon hours. IN & AROUND THE MAROON BELLS Miles one way: 1.3.  Elevation: 9,500 ft. - 10,000 ft. The trail follows the lake to the far side and meanders along the creek flowing into the lake.  This is a great place for pictures and picnics. The trail begins at Maroon Lake, 10 miles up Maroon Creek Road.  The Maroon-Snowmass Trail climbs through the Aspens to the lake.  The left trail or the scenic trail follows a river and crosses two bridges, then climbs steeply to meet with the Maroon-Snowmass Trail.  Distance to the trail is 1 3/4 miles one way. Miles one way: 8.5.  Elevation: 9,000 ft. - 12,000 ft. Miles one way: 6.2.  Elevation: 10,000 ft. - 12,500 ft.  From the top of the pass, the trail descends to the Frigid Air Pass, and Schofield Park out of Crested Butte.  The hike to Crested Butte is about 12 miles.  The top of the pass is tricky and steep.  The soil can be slick if it is wet.  The total distance is 4.6 miles one way.  After about 1/2 mile above the tree line is the Maroon-Snowmass and Willow Lake junction.  Take the left fork that ascends steadily to Buckskin Pass.  The total hiking distance is 6 1/2 miles.  Follow the directions to Crater Lake.  Then at the Crater Lake bulletin board, take the right fork.  The trail ascends steeply.  After about 1/2 mile above the tree line is the Maroon-Snowmass and Willow Lake trail junction.  At the junction, take the right fork.  The trail ascends steeply to the top of Willow Pass.  From the top of the pass, the trail descends to the junction with East Snowmass trail.  Continue straight on the trail for the last 1/2 mile to the lake.  IN & AROUND SNOWMASS Miles one way: 6.8.  Elevation: 9,400 ft. - 11,400 ft. The trail begins a short distance up Maroon Creek Road at Islen Park behind the tennis courts.  It continues across the river to Buttermilk Mountain.  The total trip of 7 miles (one way) to Snowmass Village winds through wooded areas and meadows.  This is a pleasant hike after a steep beginning.  Hikers MUST be careful to stay on the trail as it crosses private property. Miles one way: 8.2.  Elevation: 8,400 ft. - 12,600 ft. This trail is a fairly steep hike and goes through varying terrain along East Snowmass Creek.  The round trip is about 17 miles with an elevation gain of 4,200 feet.  A virtual tour from the top of Aspen Mountain, where you can hike, eat lunch at the Sundeck, play frisbee golf, or even get married.

From cool stream-side hikes to spectacular sandstone arches, the Moab area is full of exciting day-hikes suitable for the entire family.
What follows is just a taste of what Moab has to offer.
Amphitheater Loop
Corona Arch Trail Follow the trail and cairns over a low sandy pass and then down towards
the base of a large cliffs. Continue along the base of the cliff to the
first safety cable and around to the second cable where steps have been
cut into the slickrock. Corona Arch is visible from this point. From the
top of the second cable climb up over a short ledge and follow the cairns
up to the top of the large bench. From this point, it is an easy walk along
the broad slickrock bench to the base of Corona Arch.
Dellenbaugh Tunnel Fisher Towers Trail The Fisher Towers are composed of Moenkopi and Cutler sandstones, and
have eroded into many fantastical shapes. Climbers occasionally scale these
mudstone towers (be cautious of hiking directly below a climber!). Note: This trail has a western exposure and can be exceptionally hot on
summer afternoons. Mountain bikes are not allowed on this trail. Grandstaff Canyon Hidden
Valley Trail NOTE: During the late afternoon, in the summer, this trail is largely
in the shade of higher cliffs.
Hunter Canyon Ken’s Lake Trails
Longbow Arch Trail Moab Rim Trail Poison Spider Bench
Portal Overlook Trail Note: During late afternoons in the summer, this trail is largely in the

10 AM – 4 PM, Tue to Fri | 10 AM – 6 PM, Sat & Sun | closed Mon. 201-768-6001 Always tell someone where you’re going and when you expect to be back. This is just good hiking sense, no matter where you go. Wear sturdy, comfortable shoes that are not brand new. Ankle support is crucial, especially on the Giant Stairs. Shoes not broken in will likely cause blisters. Bring plenty of water — and drink it as you go. Some basic first aid supplies are always a good idea, too, as are some snacks. Dress or pack for all possible weather conditions predicted for that day. Layers are the wisest way to dress for the outdoors — you can add or remove as you go. We also recommend long-sleeved clothing, even in warmer weather. Poison ivy thrives on the Palisades. Ticks are common. Long clothing with a spray of repellent at the cuffs is your best defense. Your dog is welcome to enjoy our trails with you, but must be kept on a leash at all times. Please clean up after your pet. The steepness and erodibility of our trails make them unsuitable for cycling.

Squamish is well-known for its rock climbing, kayaking, mountain biking, kite surfing and more, but surprisingly it's the hiking in Squamish that is often overlooked. Fall in love with Squamish on foot through one of its many hiking trails that will take you on trips along rivers, lakes, ancient rainforests and vast mountainous terrain. Squamish has some truly spectacular hikes for all levels and abilities and offers everything from small half-day trips to multi-day backpacking adventures, all accessible within a 10 minutes.  Remember that hiking is often in remote places where even a small injury can turn into a rescue epic. There is wildlife, and inherent risk associated with tramping through the woods. Please keep this in mind and be mindful of your surroundings. Bring extra food, water and clothing as weather and conditions in the mountains can change instantly. Finally, pack out what you pack in to help keep our area clean.  View More Trails Trails In Squamish Squamish has a trail system that is envied around the world.

Hiking
Hiking Take a multi-day backpacking excursion, or a leisurely stroll through the desert. Find Hiking Trails   Hiking the Mountains Around Tucson Tortolita Mountains to the Northwest  Arizona National Scenic Trail     Tucson Urban Trails With weather like ours, you don't have to get out of town to get back to the great outdoors. Tucson's urban trails are a great way to unwind, get some exercise and soak up the sun or stars just minutes from wherever you may be in the city. "The Loop" is an ongoing project of more than 100 car-free miles of trails around Tucson and connecting to our neighboring communities of Marana and Oro Valley. It's great for walking, biking, skating, and even horseback riding. If it doesn't have an engine, it's good to go on The Loop. This 11-mile trail winds through Tucson's north side along the Rillito Riverbed, from Craycroft Road near mid-town nearly all the way to Interstate 10 on the city's northwest side. Don't worry about starting at either end—you can access the trail at lots of points along the way. Santa Cruz River Park Trail

A small belt pouch (60 cu.in., 1 liter) that can attach to a belt Day packs (1,000-2,000 cu.in., 17-34L) are small to mid-sized backpacks that have two shoulder straps, smaller ones may not include a waist belt. A harness system may include a small backpack, a waistpack, a vest, and several belt pouches. Clothing [ ] Clothing provides insulation from heat, cold, water or fire. It shades the body and protects it from injury from thorns and insect bites. For long trips, having enough clothes to change into is helpful, while washing or drying others. An extra pair of socks can be used as mittens. Shorts for swimming and fording streams are also useful. Wet clothes do not insulate as well and can freeze while a hiker is wearing them. If a hiker falls into ice water, an immediate dry change of clothes from a dry bag can be lifesaving. Layered clothing helps regulate body temperature in varying weather conditions. Hot-wet-weather clothing [ ] Long-sleeved shirt and long pants provide sun and insect protection, and help to reduce abrasions when plowing through brush and when slipping and falling on rocks. Sun hat Bug jackets and head-nets provide insect protection and are especially useful if the insect repellent is either not effective or runs out. These are a couple items that hikers may use to minimize the use of insect repellent on their skin. Raincoat Plastic bags made into a poncho and a rain skirt Plastic bags put on over socks then inserted into shoes Snow-ice-cold clothing [ ] Long underwear Insulated face mask to provide a solid wind barrier for extreme cold that is beyond a balaclava. Shelter [ ] Overnight shelter [ ] Continuous clothing-sleeping layers [ ] The line can blur or shift between clothing, bedding, and structural shelter. A rain-poncho and its thermal liner (or a regular poncho) is an example of equipment that can be clothing, bedding, and structural shelter. Ultralight backpackers use typical cold-weather clothes to extend the temperature ranges of their sleepingbags. Then this reasoning can extend to packing a winter coat and snow pants with a bivy bag before adding a two-pound sleeping bag. Adding an insulated pair of socks or down booties would complete the insulation layer. Basic equipment and abilities [ ] Container (see below) Cordage (see below) Fire (see below) Flashlight (UK torch) or two, preferably hands-free (headband or headlamp), spare batteries and bulb. Clothing: long-sleeved shirt and pants, hat with a full brim or used with a bandana, thin gloves Lip balm Water kit [ ] Transporting water [ ] Fire kit [ ] Cordage [ ] Cordage provides the abilities to bind, build, repair, and prevent damage. It comes in many sizes and materials, and can be used for building shelters and traps, flossing teeth, fishing, repairing and making clothes, replacing shoelaces, gluing or taping things together. Many cordages are made from natural materials. Some types of cordage are: Sewing and suturing thread, dental floss, fishing line, bank line, string, twine, clothes line. Wire, such as tripwire or snare wire, has many uses. Lanyards, straps, belts, bungee cords Climbing rope for shelters, cliffs, and scrambling Superglue Containers [ ] There are a variety of containers for organizing and keeping equipment dry: Hard-sided, plastic containers that seal using an O-ring may be used to carry critical or expensive equipment, such as electronics, and for the kit that holds the main pocket items. Food [ ] Taking foods that do not require cooking provides for higher mobility (not stopping to cook), and allows for the contingencies of not having a fire, the cook stove breaking, or running out of fuel. In general, the foods in a grocery store that are not in the refrigerated-freezer sections, are available for the trail. Flavor enhancers: salt, salt substitute, powdered peppers, spices, dried herbs, powdered bullion or cubes, hot sauce. Vegan note: The equipment in this article comes from hoping for the best and preparing for the worst, balanced with how much a hiker wants to carry and is willing to risk. Within that context, if the worse scenario happens and starvation is imminent, then it may be too late to choose and learn and be able to fish and trap. As neutrally stated, the decision becomes an informed choice. If hikers plan their food carefully, they may wind up eating more healthily on the trail. Refrigeration [ ] Cooking [ ] Alcohol stove Beverage can stove Billycan Cooking in tinfoil pockets Cooking with green-sticks Steaming food in appropriate green leaves Using a metal grill Using thin rocks as a skillet Cook stove Hobo stove Portable stove Rocket stove Shichirin Towel, bandana, or cotton T-shirt Biodegradable soap, or natural cleansers like baking soda, vinegar, pure lemon crystals Personal hygiene [ ] Equipment not already in the kitchen. Dental hygiene: toothbrush (may be sharpened for a marlin spike for rope work), etc. Feminine hygiene that doubles as first-aid and tinder: tampons, pads Toilet paper (tinder), wet wipes (sure fire) Tweezers, in a kit, in a multi-tool, on a keyring Electronics [ ] Camera, extra film/memory card Cell phone Emergency-channel scanner Flashlight, a red filter saves night vision, but reduces sight distance and signalling; carry a spare bulb. Additional equipment [ ] Jungle: machete, hammock, extra tinder and insect repellent Notepad and writing implements for leaving notes, making notes, drawing, journaling Rain-proof cover for backpack Sewing kit: scissors can be in the multi-tool, a place to store the threaded needles, dental floss and fishing line may double as thread, Kevlar thread, safety pins for repair and fishing hooks, replacements for critical buttons or fasteners. Waterproofing supplies Water bottle parka to either delay freezing or when wet, provide cooling Example checklists [ ] Wrist, optional: watch, parachute cord, fishing line, compass, altimeter, mini-versions of survival items Neck-lanyard, optional: neck knife, mini-flashlight, firesteel, lighter Keyring kit: pocket compass, whistle, P-38 can opener (backup blade), optional: keyring knife or multi-tool, mini-flashlight, small firesteel Pockets: keyring kit, lighters and firesteel, folding knife with sharpener or multi-tool with a metal file, bandana, map, cordage, optional electronics Water: water purification, non-lubed condoms, large oven bag Cordage: parachute cord, thin-wire spool, large-threaded sewing needles, dental floss, duct tape Optional: small containers of sunscreen and insect repellent, binocular/monocular, electronics. Belt: belt-pouch kits, optional: larger cutting tools, water container, sunglass case with glasses, earplugs, etc.; electronics. Belt-knife sheath may include a sharpener, a firesteel, etc. Either the belt-items are worn, or they are included in the waistpack. Waistpack (or haversack) in waterproof containers: previous kits, large-clear plastic bags, wide-mouth-metal water-bottle, space-blanket or bag, bandanas, hats, gloves, scarf, socks, light-weight-wind-rain layer, thin-long base layer, swim-hiking shorts, high-energy-ready-to-eat food, emergency trapping kit, optional electronics Small-to-mid-sized backpack: previous kits, larger cutting-chopping-sawing tools, more water containers (most collapsible for flexibility), mid-weight clothing layer, bivy bag, cooking pot with food kit, personal-hygiene kit, optional: hydration bag, cold-weather coat and pants. The light-weight-rain layer may be replaced with a heavier outer layer. Mid-to-large backpack: previous kits, sleep-system, regular-overnight shelter, snow clothing and equipment, additional food and water, optional: large bucksaw or camp-axe Possible hazards [ ] clarification needed Alligators Avalanche Bears Cliffs Dehydration Drowning Exsanguination Exposure (heights) Flash floods Hyperthermia Hypothermia Lightning Malaria Moose Poisonous animals Poisonous plants Starvation Swamps Ticks Weather Whitewater Wilderness diarrhea Wildfires See also [ ] Camping equipment Outdoor education Rock-climbing equipment Scout Outdoor Essentials Search and rescue Mini survival kits Survival skills Ten Essentials Related activities [ ] Adventure travel Camping Canoeing Cross-country skiing Dog hiking Fishing Hammock camping Hillwalking Hunting Jungle tourism Llama hiking Mountain biking Mountaineering Nordic Walking Orienteering Rafting Rock climbing Scrambling Snowshoeing Swimhiking Thru-hiking Travel backpacking Travel writing Walking tour References [ ]     ^ 2014-07-27         ^ 2014-07-24         ^     2014-07-20     2014-07-20     2014-07-20     ^ 2014-07-20     ^ 2014-07-20     2014-07-20     ^ 2014-07-20     ^     ^     ^     ^ 2014-07-25     (PDF) 2014-07-25     ^ 2014-07-25     ^ 2014-07-25     ^ 2014-07-25     ^ 2014-07-20     (PDF) 2014-07-20     2014-07-20     ^     ^ October 27,         2014-07-20     ^ 2014-07-20     2014-07-20     2014-07-20     ^ (PDF) 2014-07-20     ^ 2014-07-20     ^ 2014-07-25     ^ 2014-07-25     ^ August 6,     ^ August 6,     ^ August 6,     ^ August 6,     ^ 2014-07-27     ^ slingshot ^ condoms 2009-09-23     2009-10-06     2014-07-20     ^     ^ 2014-07-26     ^ 2014-07-26     ^ 2014-07-26     ^ 2014-07-26     ^ 2014-07-20     ^ 2014-07-20     ^ 2014-07-20     ^     ^ rehydration Bibliography [ ] Hiking equipment Survival equipment CS1 maint: Multiple names: authors list Pages with URL errors Articles needing cleanup from October 2014 All pages needing cleanup Articles containing how-to sections Articles needing additional references from October 2014 All articles needing additional references Wikipedia articles needing clarification from August 2015 Navigation menu Personal tools Not logged in Talk Contributions Create account Log in Namespaces Article Article Talk Talk Variants

Hitchhiking Contents 1 Signaling method 2 Legal status 3 Decline 4 Safety 5 Around the world 5.1 Cuba 5.2 Israel 5.3 Nepal 5.4 Netherlands 5.5 Poland 5.6 Ireland 5.7 United States 6 In popular culture 7 Notable hitchhikers 8 See also 9 References 10 External links Signaling method [ ] The hitchhikers' methods of signaling to drivers differ around the world. Many hitchhikers use various hand signals. If the hitchhiker wishes to indicate that he needs a ride, he may simply make a physical gesture or display a written sign. In North America, United Kingdom and most of Europe, the gesture involves extending the arm toward the road and sticking the thumb of the outstretched hand upward with the hand closed. For example, in the US and UK, they point their thumb up. In some African countries, the hand is held still with the palm facing upwards. In other parts of the world, such as Australia, it is more common to use a gesture where the index finger is pointed at the road. Legal status [ ] Decline [ ] The real danger of hitchhiking has most likely remained relatively constant, but the general perception of this danger has increased. ... [O]ur national tolerance for danger has gone down: things that we previously saw as reasonably safe suddenly appeared imminently threatening. This trend is not just isolated to the world of hitchhiking; it has become a pernicious artifact throughout the American cultural conscience. Safety [ ] Asking for rides at gas stations instead of signalling at the roadside. Hitchhiking during daylight hours. Around the world [ ] Cuba [ ] Israel [ ] Nepal [ ] In Nepal, hitchhiking is very common in rural areas. Many do not own cars so hitchhiking is a common practice especially in and around villages.

Hike the Hudson Valley Hike the Hudson Valley Main menu Home The Hikes Store FAQ Leave No Trace Sam’s Point   Then I took a few more steps, out onto the Wiley-Coyote-style cliff that seems to exist solely to give you the best possible view of the falls, and I understood that it wasn’t an overstatement at all.  The falls drop 180 feet to the bottom of what feels like your own private canyon.  This is indeed one of the Earth’s Last Great Places, without a doubt, and we’re lucky to have it right here in the Hudson Valley. That being said, the falls aren’t always running full steam.  Come here in late summer, and you’ll likely see a trickle with a similar gallon-per-minute rating to your favorite shower head.  But when they’re going (as they’re likely to be in spring or early summer, or after a good solid rain other times of year), man, I don’t know a nicer spot in the Hudson Valley, and maybe not in New York.  Oh, what the heck.  Maybe not in the whole world. There are also some fantastic ice caves to explore at Sam’s Point.  You can feel a cool breeze blowing through the caves even on the hottest summer day. There are some ladders on the trail through the caves, so if you brought your dog, I hope she can climb ladders, or you’ll need to give her a little help.  (If you have a St. Bernard, you could also explore some of the caves with your pooch and then turn around when you come to the ladders – you’d still get to explore a good bit of the caves that way.) Because they stay so cold, the ice caves are often impassible well into the spring.  It would be a bummer to get all the way down to the ice caves entrance to find them closed, so if you’re here in early spring or late fall, check at the visitor’s center at the trailhead to make sure they’re open. If you’re looking for a moderate hike, a 5-mile stroll from the parking area to Verkeerderkill Falls and back would be my recommendation.  That’s the hike I did on my first five visits here; it’s beautiful the whole way and not too steep.  Optionally, you could add a spur to the ice caves and another spur to Lake Maratanza, but that would be a lot of hiking for one day (I’ve never done all three in one shot, but in theory it should be pretty doable for hard-core hikers). In the trail guide below, I’ll give the hike as if you’re just visiting Verkeerderkill Falls and coming straight back (which is what I normally do here), but I’ll list optional steps, with the extra mileage you’d be tackling, if you’d like to visit the ice caves and Lake Maratanza as well.  I highly recommend visiting all three, but depending on how much hiking you like to do at once, you might be well advised to check them out in multiple visits. you should note in your trail guide that there is very limited parking at Sam’s Point and once the lot reaches its capacity, they turn away hikers. no parking on the road allowed.

If you don’t get there early on weekends, you’re very likely to be turned away! Trail guide: **UPDATE June 2016** 2.  From the parking area, head around the gate on the main trail, shown as the Loop Road on the map.  Almost immediately, you’ll have the choice to go left, towards the Huckleberry Pickers’ shacks (which are a historical curiosity, but you needn’t feel like you’ve missed out on anything if you never pay them a visit, especially if you’ve seen a shack before), or right, towards Sam’s Point.  We’re going right. 3.  Follow the decrepit old road as it gains altitude and meanders through several switchbacks.  In just a few minutes, you’ll find yourself looking up at some very cool cliffs shooting up on your left (the same ones you saw on your drive in).  At one point along the cliffs, you’ll see a giant rectangular slab of a rock on the ground in front of you.  Look at the cliff directly above it, and you can see the hole this rock left when it dislodged and fell.  I feel like I should have some sort of punchline here, but I just like that rock for some reason. 4.  As the road continues climbing, some beautiful views, complete with rocky viewing platforms, open up to your right.  Take a moment to enjoy them. 5.  The road gains enough altitude that you’re now even with the tops of the cliffs you were just walking under.  In a moment, on your left, the road opens up into what probably used to be a parking area.  If you took this left turn, you’d find yourself on a very short spur trail to Sam’s Point, a panoramic vista where, apparently, some guy named Sam survived a jump off the cliffs after angering some Native Americans.  No word on whether Sam deserved to get caught or not, but it’s a good story, anyway. I like to save Sam’s Point for last, as a grand finale before heading back to the car, but there’s no reason you couldn’t scope it out now if you just can’t stand to wait – it’s just a short walk over there.  Go ahead if you can’t control yourself.  I’ll wait here. 6.  Once you either checked out Sam’s Point or delayed your gratification for later, continue straight on the Loop Road, which is mercifully flat compared to the climb you just completed.  The bushes rise up on either side, and you won’t be able to see much to your right or left.  You’re looking for your first right turn, on the road that heads downhill towards the falls and the ice caves.  When you come to this road, turn right off the Loop Road. 7.  A very short distance after you turn off the Loop Road, the Verkeerderkill Falls trail heads off to your left, through the scrubby bushes.  This is your decision point.  Continuing straight down the road takes you to the ice caves, and adds 1.1 miles, roundtrip (that doesn’t sound like much, but it is a rather steep and slow-going 1.1 miles).  Going left takes you to the falls, a 4-mile roundtrip from this spot over very rocky terrain that generally slopes gently downhill toward the falls (though the uphill return feels somewhat less gentle). 8.  Optional step: Visit the ice caves.  Keep heading down the road, which descends steeply for .3 miles to the ice caves.  At the bottom of this road, you’ll see what must have once been the parking lot for the ice caves, back when this was a commercial attraction.  A White Trail takes you on a .5-mile loop through the caves.  Take the closest entrance, and the loop will dump you back onto the far side of the parking lot later, after you’ve caved it up.  Have fun exploring! There’s one spot one the White Trail where you have to open a door, and a light pops on in the cave (unless a previous visitor already turned it on.)  It feels like you just walked in on a surprise party for one of the seven dwarves. There are also some nice views towards the end of the loop. Once you’ve completed the loop and come back to the parking area, slog back up the road .3 miles to the spot where the Verkeerderkill Falls Trail heads off to the right. 10.  As you get closer to the falls, you’ll plunge into a magical little birch grove.  If I was a gnome, this would be my hangout. 11.  The closer you get to the falls, the steeper the trail heads downhill, and the bigger the trees get.  Finally, you’ll arrive at a stream crossing, just above the falls.  If the water is very, very high, you’ll have to follow it upstream for a while to find a crossing (this has only happened to me once, after some serious, serious rain).  Usually, it’s just an easy hop-and-a-skip to the other side, where you can stop for a moment to strike a pose, if you’re so inclined. 12.  On the far side of the creek, the trail turns downstream, and you’ll see the sign informing you that you’re now hanging out at one of the Earth’s Last Great Places. 13.  Make your way to the cliff overlook on your right.  Please be extremely careful here.  There are no guard rails, and it’s a long way down. 14.  Behold the falls, and then try to tell someone this isn’t one the Earth’s Great Places. About the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen a human being do was back in 2001, when my friend Chunks ventured onto the rocks on top of the falls to get a cool picture for his online dating profile.  I’m including the pictures here because Chunks just sent them to me, and he did, after all, risk death to have them taken.  As of this writing, Darwin thankfully hasn’t caught up with Chunks yet. 15.  After you’ve soaked in the view of the falls, retrace your steps back up the Verkeerderkill Falls Trail.  It wasn’t this steep on the way down, was it? 16.  When the Verkeerderkill Falls Trail dead-ends into the road, take a right to head back towards the Loop Road (going left here would take you to the ice caves). 17.  Once you arrive back at the Loop Road, you have another decision to make.  Take a right, and in about a quarter-mile, you’ll see Lake Maratanza, a very nice place to visit and perhaps let Fido take a well-deserved dip.  Go left, and you’ll head back to Sam’s Point and your car.  Visiting Lake Maratanza is NOT a loop, and it’s about .5 miles up-and-back (you could make it a loop, but it’s a pretty boring slog with power lines and radio towers in your face most of the way.  Better to make a visit to Lake Maratanza an up-and-back venture.) Hang out beside the lake (no human swimming allowed) and enjoy the sunshine for a moment.  When you’re done, head back the way you came.  (My last time here, I took my friends all the way around the Loop Road, and I regretted it.  There’s not much to see after the lake, besides the Huckleberry Pickers’ shacks, which look exactly like you might expect.  Tempting as it is to complete the entire Loop Road, I recommend heading back toward Sam’s Point, which is much more scenic.) 19.  Head back towards Sam’s Point on the Loop Road (taking a left onto the Loop Road if you’re coming up on the road from Verkeerderkill Falls or the ice caves, or heading straight on the Loop Road if you’re coming from Lake Maratanza.) 20.  Whether or not you stopped at Sam’s Point on the way in, take a stop there now, across the old parking lot on your right.  If angry people are chasing you, consider taking desperate measures.  Otherwise, just relax and enjoy the view. 21.  After you’ve taken a picture or two at Sam’s Point, follow your steps back down the road to your car.  Once you get there, try to think of a better way you could have spent ten dollars.     (And if your device doesn’t like “Cragsmoor” as the town, try it with “Pine Bush” instead.  One hiker reported that this worked better for her.)   Was this trail guide useful to you?  Please leave a comment!

(The spot where you say “There’s one spot one the White Trail where you have to open a door, and a light pops on in the cave”) 0 ↓ Laura said: I went today and the trails were open except for the ice caves and the waterfall trails. Also the wall that is pictured at sams point is no longer there it’s just open rocks ! 1 ↓ Deanna said: Does anybody know if the trail to the falls has reopened? I went here last summer, paid $20 (Yup. Not $10) for parking, just to be told that the trail we wanted to take was closed off. I know that some trails were open but not the one to the falls. Awosting falls wasn’t too far off so we went there, but I’m hoping to try back here soon and don’t want to take the hour and a half drive to find out the falls are still closed! 0 ↓ Mike said: She also confirmed that parking is still $10 per car.
Not sure what happened last summer with getting charged $20 – bummer!
Hope this all helps — looks like it’s still a waiting game for the ice caves and falls. 2 ↓ Deanna said: Hi Mike!
Thanks so much for all the information! That’s very helpful! I’ll be sure to look out for those trails reopening. 1 ↓ Sonya Terjanian said: Does anyone know if the trail has reopened?
Thanks! 0 ↓ Kristin said: I just checked the site today and it seems to be open!
https://parks.ny.gov/parks/193/details.aspx 0 ↓ amycs said: It is *NOT* open.
The Verkeerderkill Falls trail remains closed, as listed in the link posted, and as well on the link this website has posted.
I spoke to park staff today (6/7/17) at the visitor’s center, and they explained not only was that trail and surrounding area burned last summer, it just so happens that the falls are on private property, and the owners of that property have requested that no one access the falls.
It was also mentioned that it probably won’t be reopened until next year. 1 ↓ Mike said: Thanks for the update, Amy!
Looks like the ice caves are open again, along with the loop around Lake Maratanza and Sam’s Point itself, but we shouldn’t be holding our breath for the Verkeerderkill Falls trail to reopen.
When I called about a month ago, they sounded hopeful that it might reopen soon – they were getting ready to do a new assessment then.
Your information is more current, and the assessment must not have gone as well as they’d hoped.
Sigh.
At least the official Sam’s Point web site seems to be kept up-to-date — we can just keep hitting refresh and hoping. 0 ↓ Tony said: I remember hiking the high point loop 12 years ago
and not seeing a soul until getting back to the lot. Did the same loop a few years back and was amazed to see the number of folks throughout my hike. You’re right about the results of sharing photos on social media. I hope all the trails open up by this coming spring but I highly doubt that will happen. 0 ↓ Michelle said: Is this kid friendly? I’d keep it to the shorter portion of the hike, but as far as difficult and danger level is this okay for kids? 0 ↓ erica said: Michelle, did you take your kids?
I’m curious, thinking of taking mine this weekend. 0 ↓ Michelle said: No unfortunately not yet 🙁 when I wanted to go the trails I wanted to take were still closed due to the fire. I think they still are but I could be wrong. 0 ↓ Bodlodroid said: 0 ↓ Erica said: Ok great! Thank you so much for your reply.
Picked up trekking poles and going to give it a go.
It looks like most of the trails have reopened. 0 ↓ Bodlodroid said: Be safe and pls post how it was when you get back 0 ↓ Paul Hanley said: According to the official NY state website for Minnewaska/Sam’s Point, some of Sam’s Point area has re-opened as of late May, 2016. Sam’s Point overlook and ice caves (and corresponding roads/trails) are open. Verkeerderkill Falls area and trail are closed. Check website for more specific info and closure map. 2 ↓ Mike said: 1 ↓ Mike said: You may do well to plan your adventures elsewhere for the time being. 1 ↓ bodlodroid said: Thank you for saving me a few hours of my life, I would have gone this Sunday for nothing. Never could have imagined this! A huge part of Minnewaska State Park was in blaze. Just called Sam’s Point to confirm – they are closed until further notice. 2 ↓ Jim H said: Thanks again for highlighting a great hike in the region.
The Ice Caves were a lot of fun!
A tight fit in some spots, but very cool.
No snow left in October – just in time for a new batch.
I also got lucky that there was water flowing over the falls! Please keep up the good work! 1 ↓ Mike said: Awesome, thanks for the report, Jim!
You picked a perfect day for it. 0 ↓ Linda said: Has anyone hiked to the falls lately? Wondering if it is worth going there so late in the summer? – looking to go this weekend Aug 15/16.
thanks! 0 ↓ tim said: Linda, we hiked to the falls for the 1st time earlier this summer.
Even though the falls were not very active (dry spring), they was still very pretty.
However, we found the hike to be a lot of work.
The trail is VERY rocky and you really can’t look up for fear of tripping.
So you’re head is always down watching your feet and missing the scenery.
We find the Ice Caves hike is a bit more leisurely and enjoyable. 1 ↓ Linda said: Thanks for the feedback Tim! 0 ↓ Mike said: Looks like they’re still going pretty good there.
I would generally expect the falls to be a trickle at this time of year, but it looks like they might be doing better than that now, despite the general lack of rain we’ve had (today’s storms may have helped some, too).
Best of luck if you give it a go! 0 ↓ Linda said: Mike, thanks for the info. It does look good – better than I expected! We ended up not going this weekend – opted for some biking – but its still on my list. Thanks so much for your website! Its an incredible resource that my friends and I use all the time! Enjoy! 0 ↓ Nancy said: Wondering if anyone knows if the ice caves are now open?
Looking to visit there in a couple of days (7/1/15). Thanks! 0 ↓ Mike said: “The Ice Caves Trail is open effective Saturday June 6, 2015. The Ice Caves Trail contains ice flows, water, narrow crevices, low rock ceilings, darker areas, ladders and boardwalks. Please use extra caution in all areas. Appropriate footwear must be worn due to difficult footing. For additional information please contact the Sam’s Point Visitor Center.” 0 ↓ Tim said: check that – rain not until weekend 0 ↓ Tim said: Mike, thanks for the response – I have friends in Cragsmoor and they were evacuated yesterday.
So as of Monday, apparently Cragsmoor is no longer safe either.
Rain expected tomorrow so that may help. 0 ↓ George said: Any thoughts on what happened to the young officer up there yesterday ? Was going to do that hike but got a late start and did bonticou crag instead ….. Pretty scary 0 ↓ Brianna said: The ice caves trail was and is still closed … There was no reason for this to have even have happened if they had stayed on the open trails. It’s a very sad accident but why were they on a closed trail? 0 ↓ Mike said: George, Brianna, I hadn’t heard about this until seeing your comments.
Scary stuff indeed, and a harsh reminder to obey signage — when a trail is closed, you can pretty much guarantee it’s closed for good reason.
0 ↓ Tim said: I am concerned about the fires in the area.
The local news is not giving specific fire locations but it appears very widespread.
Is Sams Point being affected? 0 ↓ Mike said: 0 ↓ Vinny said: We hiked Sam’s Point for the first time yesterday. Your trail guide was great!.
The ice caves were closed as of 5/3/15. The falls were running nicely. The dwarf pine and birch tree fields on the way to the falls were magical.
The falls trail was dry with very few mud spots, all easily avoided. Just a hint for early morning hikers like myself. The paid parking lot does not open until 9 a.m. There is no parking outside the gate. I arrived at 7 and took a chance by parking outside the gate. I returned to my car at 9:45. a.m. just before the Sheriff started ticketing vehicles.
Thanks for the great website. 0 ↓ Michelle said: Is camping allowed on this trail? By the way I love your website so much. 0 ↓ Ashby said: Quick question… Do you think this trail is doable with a 18 month old? I have a backpack that she can sit in and is generally pretty happy. I want to take her hiking this weekend but worry this might be a bit too much. I’ve active and hike pretty often.
Thanks! 0 ↓ Mike said: Hi Ashby!
Doable, yes, but the trail to the falls especially is very rocky and the footing can be tricky.
I’d highly recommend using trekking poles if you give it a go — they’ll help you stay on your feet and avoid any mishaps.
Good luck! 0 ↓ Kathee said: Sam’s Point is open.
We went there today (4/3/2015).
The Ice Caves Trail is closed.
Still lots of ice/slush on the trails.
We didn’t go further than Sam’s Point because it started pouring, so, can’t comment on the rest of the park. 0 ↓ Mike said: Thanks for this very helpful comment, Kathee!
I just updated the trail guide accordingly.
Hope you can see more of the sights next time! 0 ↓ Brianna said: Was so excited, as this is one of my favorite places & made the drive up today but it was closed. After calling the line the machine stated closed till further notice so I found on the website they’re doing cliff renovations. Make sure you call before you head up if its any time soon. Luckily there are many other near by places. 0 ↓ Mike said: Hi Brianna – so sorry to hear it!
Is the overlook the only thing that’s closed?
From the post on the website, it looks like it: “OVERLOOK CLOSED: Beginning Monday, November 10th and continuing until further notice, access to the Sam’s Point Overlook will be closed due to cliff restoration. We apologize for any inconvenience.” The overlook is awesome, but to me, the waterfall is the real money spot on this hike, followed by the ice caves, overlook and lake, so it’d still be worth a trip.
But if you can’t get to any of that, I’d like to get the trail guide updated with a big fat warning not to waste your time.
Thanks for any more light you can shed on this one, and thank you for taking the time to let us know about the closure! 0 ↓ Brianna said: I couldn’t even pull into the parking lot, the gate was across saying closed so I wasn’t able to get to any part of it. I love the falls and the ice caves, it’s one of my favorite places to explore. I also just found out there’s a place that is almost the next road over from Sams called Bears Hill Nature Preserve. It looks like a simple little stroll just out to the same Gunks ridge but haven’t checked it out yet myself just thought I’d through that one out there to for future adventures! Happy hiking (: 0 ↓ Mike said: Thanks for helping to keep other people from driving all the way out there just to be disappointed.
Happy adventuring! 0 ↓ Mike said: 0 iryna said: is it worth going end of October or better wait till summer and go hiking somewhere else? thanks ahead 🙂 0 ↓ Mike said: It’s always worth it at Sam’s Point, but the falls are likely to be a trickle this time of year.
The leaves would more than make up for it, though — enjoy if you pay a visit! 0 ↓ Jessica Rubin said: Hi Mike, I love this hike.
I’ve done it a number of times along with the Lemon Squeeze at Mohonk.
Can you recommend any similar hikes in the area. Jessica 0 ↓ Mike said: If you see one with a short description that looks like a winner, you can click the thumbnail image of the hike to visit the full trail guide.
You’ve already picked two of my favorites – hope that helps you find some more! 0 ↓ amanda said: I love it here I go at least once a month. I bring my 3 Newfoundlands w my brother. We love the hunks minmewaska included but Sam’s point is my favorite. For an intense hike try the ice caves verkeerdekill falls continue to the high rock point I can’t reember the name ATM and come back around to the trail around the lake it should be 9 to 10 miles and take from 3-5 hours depending on your speed. The view is well worth the difficult climb. 0 ↓ Will said: Just got back today (April 4) and we had a great time. Thanks for such a great trail description! Most of the snow had melted, not enough to open up the ice caves, but plenty for a roaring waterfall. The walk around the long trail was wonderful- it’ll only get more scenic as the trees grow foliage and the critters settle in. Thanks again for your guide. 0 ↓ Cee said: Hi! I know this might be a silly question to ask. But by any chance, do you think it would be OK for not-so-experienced hikers to go during this season (maybe this Saturday, with a possible snow?). We did Breakneck Ridge last Spring (plus Mt. Taurus/ Anthony’s Nose/ Lake Minnewaska during the summer) and didn’t die if that makes a legitimate reference. We used your trail guides so thank you for that! 🙂 0 ↓ Mike said: Hi, Cee!
Not silly at all!
But it’s gotta still be very snowy up there, even with things starting to (finally) warm up a bit.
Another hiker asked about climbing Mt. Beacon in the winter, and I think the response I gave him applies here, too:
“I’m afraid I won’t be much help on this one – I’ve never been up there in the snow before. I can’t promise that it’d be safe. Beautiful, most definitely, but you’ll have to prepare responsibly and make good decisions for yourself. (Sorry to be lame, but without knowing people’s abilities and experience, I’m really hesitant to make blanket recommendations about hiking in potentially dangerous conditions.) Whatever you decide to do, and whenever you get there, I hope you enjoy it and take lots of pictures!” (Note: The dude I gave this advice went anyway and said it was one of the most amazing experience of his life.
But I’d sure hate for someone to slide off a cliff because I told them it’d be safe, when I can’t say for sure that it would be.
And the trail to the falls at Sam’s Point is very rocky – could be quite slick out there.)
If you decide to go, I hope it’s a great experience! 0 ↓ Liz said: 0 ↓ Mark said: Just finished hiking this over the weekend, have to say it was pretty amazing.
We started at 11:30 am taking the left at the parking lot onto the Loop Road.
Went to the viewing point of the lake off Loop Road, Indian Rock, up to the High Point, down to Verkeerder Falls, the Ice Caves, and the back to the parking lot.
Finished up at 7:10 p.m.
Didn’t really read the map much until afterwards.
Inititially I thought we were doing a 5 mile hike, but it seems in accordance to the map it was 10.5 ish.
It got brutal towards the end.
Went with a group of four + 2 dogs and I think we were all pretty beat up by the end, but overall great time and would highly recommend taking a visit to this location. 0 ↓ Juan said: What a wonderful writeup. After looking at a number of places, this definitely stands out based on distance, difficulty, and reward. I’m planning on going this weekend… can anyone comment on how busy it will be and what time parking will fill up by? I’m coming from NYC so it’ll be around a 2-hour drive for me. What time should I get there to be safe? 0 ↓ Jean said: We hiked there last Sunday.
We arrived around 9:15 am and the parking lot had only about three cars in it.
When we got back around 2:30 pm, the parking lot was completely full with no spaces at all.
It was a beautiful hike – enjoy! 0 ↓ Juan said: That’s good to know Jean, thanks so much! So excited for tomorrow! 0 ↓ Mike said: Thank you, Jean!
And have a great trip out there tomorrow, Juan — looks like a perfect day for it! 0 ↓ Jean said: We hiked both Verkeerderkill Falls and the Ice Caves today, after reading about them on your site, and it was awesome.
Just wanted to say thanks for all of the detailed information and tips – great site! 1 ↓ Mike said: When the water’s high, sometimes you don’t have a choice but to dip your feet when you’re trying to get to the falls!
That shouldn’t be the case this time of year, though.
Lake Maratanza (step 18 above) or the stream just above the falls (step 11) should do the trick.
And the ice caves are cool pretty much all the time.
Hope you have a great trip!
You picked a great hike to check out. 0 ↓ Toni Ann said: Hi.
I am not an experienced hiker, but just climbed to the top of the Kaaterskills Falls in Tannersville and now I want more!!
I am thinking of visiting the falls and ice cave this upcoming weekend.
Are there any places to cool off?
i don’t mean swim, but dip your feet at least?
just curious!! 🙂 0 ↓ Connie Miller said: Wow, your summary gives it great justice! Thanks! 0 ↓ Mike said: Thank you, Connie! 0 ↓ Irena said: Loved your description. I was there years ago with Wild Earth Adventure club, but now want to go with a friend. You made me so badly to come back, beautiful pictures and very thorough directions. I am going to use it as a guide tomorrow. Thank you for taking time to share your experience. 0 ↓ Mike said: Thanks for the very kind words, and that’s awesome that you’re using this guide!
I hope you have a great day out there. 0 ↓ Ryan said: This really is one of earth’s last great places. Sam’s point is awesome and the falls are gorgeous!
I went down to the ice caves and they were really cool, both literally and figuratively.
Didn’t make to the lake (my knees rebelled after the falls trail, which I would say is not just very rocky in parts, but just plain very rocky throughout.
I felt like I was getting a break if there five feet of the trail with no rocks), maybe next time.
Totally worth the ten bucks.
Thanks for this site.
I use it all the time to find places to hike.
I almost always say that the last place I hiked is my new favorite place, but Sam’s point is going to be hard to top. 0 ↓ Mike said: That’s great news that you’re getting some use out of this site!
Really glad to hear it.
I also don’t know why I ever used the phrase “rocky in parts” to describe the falls trail — I took out the “in parts” part.
There.
That’s better.
Thank you!
And man, I need to get back out here again.
Sam’s Point really is tough to top. 0 ↓ Christopher said: We hiked here last Sunday and you really don’t have to wait long for some gorgeous views. Headed to the ice caves first (one of the coolest places on this hike) then took the trail to the falls. A lot of that trail was flooded with ankle deep water due to the rainfall last week, but it made the falls that much better when we got there with our wet feet! Wonderful place! Thanks again for the info. 0 ↓ Mike said: Glad you had a good day out there!
And thanks for the heads-up about the water on the trail, too.
Hope your wet feet have forgiven me for not calling that out in the trail guide — it’s now updated with a warning about the trail’s less-than-stellar drainage. 0 ↓ Your email address will not be published. * * * * Recent Comments Andrey Breakneck Ridge Breakneck to Close for Repairs - http://highlandscurrent.com/2017/09/15/breakneck-close-repairs/ Sep 15, 15:28 A Surprise Lake II (via Greenwood Lake overlook) We got there before 10 am and the parking was fine.

Ten Great Hikes in New Jersey
0 What You Need Hiking boots come in two options: a high top for better ankle support
or low top for comfort. Military boots are also good for hiking, but
are heavy and need to be broken in prior to your adventure. Boots are
also a necessity since snakes and spiders are a common occurrence in the
Northeast, but whichever boot you opt for, just make sure you can tuck
the bottom of your pants into them so that a tick can’t sneak onto your
leg. If wearing a low top boot, grab some duct tape and tape the bottom
of your pants closed around your leg instead. Hazards of Hiking There are a few hazards that come with hiking – mainly wandering off
the trail and becoming lost, injuring your foot or ankle, being bitten
by an animal or dehydration. Above all, stay together while hiking - you
should never hike by yourself. If you do become lost, first of all Do Not Panic. Remain calm and
begin by looking at your compass and map to determine where you may be –
if nothing else, determine which direction is north. Secondly, check to
see if you have cell phone service to call for help. If there is a
clearing near where you are standing, move into the clearing so that
emergency help can locate you easily. Where to Go More from Teaneck Patch Patch Community Guidelines Patch welcomes contributions and comments from our users.

Anthony's Nose Hike
Appalachian Trail
Arden Point and Glenclyffe
It doesn’t get much easier then stepping off the train and on to the trailhead. After taking the Metro North to the Garrison stop, you’ll see two stone pillars and a sign for “Arden Point – Hudson Highlands State Park.” You’ll follow that for a 3.7-mile circuit passing several panoramic viewpoints over the Hudson. Bonus: you’ll get to walk along a historic road Benedict Arnold used to escape during the Revolutionary War.   Advertising
Big Indian Mountain
Blue Mountain Reservation Loop
There’s no better motivation for getting some exercise than the promise of a crisp beer at the end. This 12-mile loop starts about a mile from the Peekskill Metro North stop and once on the trail, you’ll be able to hit to viewpoints over the Hudson River and pass a serene pond along the way. On your way back to the train, make sure to stop at the Peekskill Brewery to reward yourself for tackling the climb.
Breakneck Ridge Trail
Advertising
Camp Smith Trail
If the Appalachian Trail and Bear Mountain are a bit crowded, this three-and-a-half-mile hike is great for a little solo strolling. The rolling hills are great for some fitness but aren't overwhelmingly difficult. With fairly easy terrain, even your four-legged friend can join you on the trail. Take the Metro-North Hudson line to Peekskill Station for free shuttles to the Bear Mountain Inn where you can hike up to see incredible Hudson Valley vistas.
Doodletown Bridle Path Loop
Franny Reese State Park
In less than two hours, Metro-North's Hudson line brings you to Poughkeepsie, where a whole day of activities await you. Start with a stroll on the Walkway Over the Hudson (the world’s longest pedestrian bridge perched 212 feet above the river) before heading west into Franny Reese State Park. There are two-and-a-half miles of trails with sites like an old carriage road, ruins of a 19th-century estate and superb views of the Mid-Hudson Bridge. Reward yourself with dinner at one of the many restaurants nearby before heading home.
Advertising
Indian Rock/Wanaque Ridge Trail Loop
Lakes? Check. Babbling brooks? Check. Stunning views? Check. This 5.5-mile hike has it all. After taking NJ Transit's #197 bus from the Port Authority to the intersection of Ringwood Avenue and Second Avenue in Wanaque, you’ll walk just under a mile to begin your journey. You'll climb the scenic Ramapo Lake and follow the Wanaque Ridge Trail along the western ridge of the Ramapo Mountains where you’ll spot stunning views over New Jersey and Ramapo Lake.     Find the best hiking trails in America Hit one of these epic hiking trails to experience some of America’s most iconic and dramatic landscapes at ground level

On marijuana, 59 percent of voters support allowing adults to legally possess small amounts of marijuana for recreational use.  The only group opposed is Republicans, who are 53 to 43 percent against the idea. Voters over 65 years old are split, with 47 percent in favor and 50 percent opposed.  Still, 55 percent of voters say they would "definitely not try" marijuana if it were legal, while 9 percent say they would "definitely try" it and 12 percent say they would "probably try it."  New Jersey Democrats have introduced a bill that would make New Jersey the ninth state in the U.S. to legalize and tax marijuana. On guns, Thursday's poll shows 96 percent of voters are in favor of requiring background checks for all gun buyers. Only 3 percent oppose. The survey also found 63 percent say New Jersey would be less safe if more people carried firearms, while 28 percent say it would be safer.  The results are not surprising. Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans nearly 2-to-1 in the state.  The poll was conducted via phone from Sept. 7-12 with 1,121 registered New Jersey voters. The margin-of-error was plus-or-munes 4 percentage points.  nj.com About Us More on NJ.com NJ.com Sections Contribute to NJ.com
